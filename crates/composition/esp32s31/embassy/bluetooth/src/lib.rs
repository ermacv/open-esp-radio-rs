//! ESP32-S31 Bluetooth LE radio composition over Embassy-compatible time.
//!
//! The Bluetooth Controller is a client of the shared radio
//! (`oer-esp32s31-radio-runtime`). [`BluetoothParked::new`] claims the static
//! controller memory once per boot: the BLE PHY environment, the
//! direction-finding workspace, one pool per role and both global receive
//! chains, all placed in internal SRAM. [`start`] then runs one Controller
//! epoch from the parked partition to an installed radio runtime:
//!
//! 1. enters common radio power and enables the Bluetooth module clocks,
//!    Controller resets and low-power timer clock;
//! 2. runs Controller HAL, scheduler and modem low-power initialization;
//! 3. prepares the shared PHY through the radio system, joins it and the
//!    shared BTBB baseband, tracking the PHY when the join makes it due;
//! 4. enables the BLE base stack and publishes the public address;
//! 5. prepares Controller output, starts the runtime timer, publishes both
//!    interrupt owners and binds the three CPU routes to one dispatcher;
//! 6. installs the radio role in the runtime.
//!
//! The dispatcher services source 124, 127 and 133 and forwards the scheduler
//! and source-127 worker wakes. [`BluetoothSystem::run`] drives the radio
//! runtime and the source-127 timer task until a fault stops either, and
//! publishes the Controller's active roles as Bluetooth LE status bits in the
//! radio system's coexistence schedule. Each epoch enables coexistence for
//! Bluetooth when it starts and disables it when it stops, after withdrawing
//! every status bit.
//! [`BluetoothSystem::stop`] reverses the epoch and returns the parked
//! partition with the controller memory back at its allocation-time image,
//! ready for the next [`start`]. Periodic PHY tracking belongs to the radio
//! system (`RadioSystem::run_tracking`).
//!
//! [`start_bluetooth_hci`] then creates the HCI Controller over that runtime
//! once per boot: the in-process transport, whose Host end goes to the Host
//! stack, and the service that runs the portable Controller core with the
//! runtime as its radio. Between Controller epochs the service retires the
//! drained Host end and restarts it with a fresh core.
//! [`BluetoothEntropy`] binds the SoC entropy service as its random source.
//!
//! Power and clock failures roll back to the parked client; any failure
//! after the first Controller write keeps its owners fail-stop.
