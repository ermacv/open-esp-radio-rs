//! The HIL scenario model ([#761]): what a scenario is, independently of
//! how a run executes it.
//!
//! A scenario is a Rust type implementing [`Spec`]: its stable
//! [`ScenarioId`], its one purpose as a marker type ([`Conformance`],
//! [`Interop`], [`Measurement`], [`Investigation`]), the contract it
//! exercises ([`Subject`]), typed parameters, criteria, trace and
//! findings, the [`Resources`] and [`TargetCapabilities`] it needs, an
//! [`Estimate`] derived from its waits, and a pure [`Spec::verdict`] over a
//! recorded trace. Because the verdict is a pure function of the trace and
//! the criteria, a reader can recompute it without a new run; this crate is
//! a `formats` package so that it may.
//!
//! A contract's bounds are its port conformance crate's own type, with a
//! `CEILINGS` constant; a conformance trace starts with the
//! `oer-hil-trace-header` header that carries the backend's actual bounds
//! (#761, owner decision 6223045367).
//!
//! Time is never a literal here. A [`Wait`] is a contract ceiling, a typed
//! protocol interval ([`ProtocolQuantity`]) or a span measured on the
//! stand ([`StandProfile`]); arithmetic on it is checked ([`Overflow`]),
//! and a stand span used before its evidence suffices carries a
//! [`Provisional`] label.
