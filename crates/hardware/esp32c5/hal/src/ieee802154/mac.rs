//! Driver-facing owners of the dedicated IEEE 802.15.4 MAC registers.

//! The task owner and the active interrupt owner together drive the MAC
//! through the [`ll`](crate::ieee802154::ll) backend. The interrupt owners
//! expose the reviewed activation and teardown transitions. The owners are
//! made from and returned to the PAC partition; the MAC lifecycle that will
//! own clocks, reset and foundation around them is not part of this crate
//! yet.
