//! Chip-independent finite shutdown for tasks attached to a Wi-Fi epoch.
//!
//! A radio runner can return while an executor task still owns protocol
//! scratch or queue leases. This module provides a split ownership contract:
//! the parent receives only the stop/wait capability, while the task receives
//! only the request/return capability. A dropped task endpoint poisons the
//! resources, so a replacement epoch cannot erase an unreturned owner.
//! Waiting only observes readiness: each controller retains its returned owner
//! outside the observation future. `try_finish(self)` consumes the capability
//! and returns that owner once. A timeout or cancelled wait leaves the same
//! group available for another observation, including after one child stops.
