//! One research driver for indirect jumps through tables, shared by every
//! consumer of the value analysis.
//!
//! A first pass over a function locates its dispatches; a
//! [`JumpTableSource`] proves the entries of each table it can from the
//! build's facts, and the function is analyzed again following them, which
//! can reach a dispatch only a table's case leads to (a nested `switch`). A
//! pass is kept only while its own records prove again every table it
//! followed, unchanged, and more: then the records it emits are exactly
//! those the reported tables' jumps produced. A pass that proves the same
//! tables ends the search; one that loses or changes a table (a case label
//! jumping back into its dispatch block) means no table is proven, and the
//! function is reported from a pass that follows none, its dispatches
//! indirect gaps. Passes end within the function's dispatch count, every
//! pass charged to the same control.
