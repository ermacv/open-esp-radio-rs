//! The stack gate of an image build. One analysis of each ELF
//! (`oer-riscv-stack`, with the pinned ROM ELF and its reviewed summaries)
//! bounds every stack the image runs on:
//!
//! - the runtime's interrupt stacks (`oer-image-check-interrupts`);
//! - each task stack the policy names, from the function that runs on it
//!   (its root, by symbol): the root's worst-case call chain must leave the
//!   stack's storage the policy's minimum free bytes;
//! - the bootstrap image's stack, from its root likewise.
//!
//! A task stack's bound may be `partial + ?`: the root reaches indirect sites
//! no fact resolves (an executor's task polls, trait objects). The gate then
//! accepts it, holds the part it proves to the budget and lists every
//! unresolved site with its reason; the runtime's stack painting stays the
//! check of the exercised call chains. A root symbol the image lacks fails,
//! as does an image without compiler frame records or a linked function
//! without a record that the coverage review does not explain.
