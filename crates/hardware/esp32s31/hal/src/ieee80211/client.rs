//! Wi-Fi as a client of the shared radio arbiter.
//!
//! The concurrent split hands Wi-Fi its MAC partition and interrupt setup;
//! common radio power, the modem clocks and every shared register stay with
//! the arbiter. These owners follow ESP-IDF's bring-up: common power, then
//! `modem_clock_module_enable(PERIPH_WIFI_MODULE)`, then the Wi-Fi
//! initialized status that keeps the Wi-Fi clocks enabled while Wi-Fi is
//! initialized. Each stage proves only its own step; MAC, PHY and RF
//! readiness are later stages.
//!
//! A clocked client borrows its capabilities with the arbiter lease: the
//! cold MAC HAL and the channel HAL take the shared registers from the lease
//! for one transaction, the MAC reset pulses through it, and the runtime MAC
//! HAL needs no lease because the Wi-Fi hot path touches Wi-Fi registers
//! only. After cold MAC setup [`WifiClocked::into_running`] splits the client
//! into the task-side [`RadioRuntimeOwner`] and the MAC interrupt setup;
//! [`WifiClocked::from_running`] reunites a stopped runtime epoch.
