//! Trace points and the post-mortem snapshot of the shared PHY domain.
//!
//! Every event the PHY records into [`oer_trace`] is defined here with its
//! channel, so the host decodes a drained record with the same type. The
//! types are chip-neutral: a chip's PHY maps its own errors onto [`Refusal`]
//! and [`Fault`] before it emits. One channel gates one event, so the host
//! can leave the 1 Hz tracking tick off while it records lifecycle edges.
//!
//! | index | event                     | rate                                   |
//! |-------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
//! | 0     | [`Registration`]          | one start and one end per cold boot    |
//! | 1     | [`TrackingTick`]          | one per vendor tracking period (1 s)   |
//! | 2     | [`RfLifecycle`]           | one per last-client close or wake      |
//! | 3     | [`ClientChange`]          | one per protocol start or stop         |
//! | 4     | [`TemperatureReferences`] | one per tracking commit                |
//! | 5     | [`Poison`]                | at most one per registration           |
//! | 6     | [`WifiChannel`]           | one per Wi-Fi channel selection        |
//!
//! [`record_poison`] emits [`Poison`], freezes the trace
//! [`Poison::POST_TRIGGER_ENTRIES`] entries later and captures a
//! [`PhySnapshot`], which survives the fail-stop reset that follows.
