//! Each executor's cycles in its idle wait over an explicit window, from
//! which a per-core CPU load follows. No image enables it and nothing reports
//! the load since #770; it returns with #761's core-1 sampling.
//!
//! With `idle-accounting`, an executor's run loop reads the 64-bit `mcycle`
//! of its core before and after its `wfi`, with interrupts masked, and adds
//! the difference to that executor's idle counter. The interrupt that ends
//! the wait runs only after the second read, so the counter holds the time
//! the core waited and nothing else: tasks, interrupt handlers and the
//! executor's own polling are busy time. The cost is two 64-bit CSR reads and
//! a single-writer counter update per wait, none per poll or per interrupt.
//!
//! `mcycle` must count while the core waits. The ESP32-S31 leaves
//! `HP_SYSTEM_CPU_WAITI_CONF.CPU_WAIT_MODE_FORCE_ON` at its reset value, 1,
//! which keeps the core clock running in `wfi`; an image that clears it
//! reads every wait as zero idle cycles, and so a load near 100 % on an idle
//! link.
//!
//! A [`Window`] samples every running executor's counter at its beginning
//! and its end, with the calling core's `mcycle` as the window's length:
//! the cores share one clock. A core waiting at a boundary has not yet
//! added its current wait, so the sampler raises that executor's software
//! interrupt and waits until the core has added it: the wait then counts up
//! to the boundary plus its wake-up latency, at the cost of one extra
//! executor poll on that core per boundary. A core that does not answer
//! within a bounded number of attempts is reported as unmeasured.
