//! The HIL observer's build identity, as data a run records.
//!
//! The runner is the observer of every HIL run, and the qualification
//! evaluator independently decides whether a run's observer still observes
//! the checkout. Both compute the same identity from the same parts, defined
//! here: the projection of the runner's resolved dependency graph onto the
//! inputs each workload uses ([`inputs`], [`cargo_inputs`]), Cargo's actual
//! compilation units bound to the executable ([`artifacts`]), the content
//! store a run's observer record refers to ([`store`]) and the receipt an
//! invocation of the runner carries ([`receipt`]). Building the runner,
//! resolving its graph and preparing its receipt is `oer-hil-observer`'s;
//! evaluators read the prepared descriptors here.

/// Version of an observer build (`build.schema`).
///
/// Schema 3 records the runner's resolved Cargo graph as Cargo's graph:
/// `resolved.packages` holds each of Cargo's nodes (a package with its
/// features) once, the runner first, with the indices of the nodes it
/// depends on in `edges`. A package that is both a normal and a build
/// dependency with different features is two nodes; a reader merges a
/// package's nodes ([`inputs::projection`]). Schema 2 recorded the
/// graph as a tree with a node per path to a package, hundreds of megabytes;
/// no reader for it remains, so an observation recorded with it is not this
/// observer's.
