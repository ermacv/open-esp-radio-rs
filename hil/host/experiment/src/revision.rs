//! A revision's scenario set, run with the runner that speaks its HIL wire.
//!
//! The revision is checked out, detached, in a worktree below the
//! experiment's directory. A revision whose HIL protocol version
//! (`hil/protocol/messages.lock`) is this checkout's runs on this
//! checkout's runner and host code with the revision's firmware, built from
//! a source snapshot of the worktree. A revision with another protocol
//! version runs its own runner, built in the worktree, inside a whole-stand
//! lease: that runner gets a private arbiter directory holding a copy of the
//! stand file (and of an older device registry), so it neither waits for nor
//! disturbs the shared arbiter, whose schema it may not read, and the
//! worktree's run directory links to the shared store. An older runner
//! reads the same settings under older names (`OER_HIL_ARBITER_DIR`,
//! `OER_HIL_OWNER`) and may keep its runs in a directory of its own below
//! the worktree's `target/hil`: such a run is moved into the store's
//! `revision-runs` directory before the worktree goes, where it outlives the
//! checkout. One launch on a revision is shared by [`run`]
//! and every [`crate::bisect`] step; every run goes
//! through [`crate::launch::launch_run`], and its run is the one its receipt
//! names.
//!
//! [`run`] records one typed report, `report.json`: the revision, the
//! runner that ran it and each scenario's outcome. It pairs no measurement
//! with another revision's: a revision with another wire may measure
//! differently.
