//! The arbiter of the channel one radio's station and access point share:
//! the third sans-IO machine of their loop ([owner decision on #563]).
//!
//! Only the arbiter changes the port's channel: it closes the transmit
//! gate, retunes the port and opens the gate again, one gate's cycle at a
//! time. The station asks it for a channel and holds the [`Lease`] it
//! answers with; the access point tells it its schedule and follows its
//! commands. A station alone has an arbiter of the same shape, which
//! leases at once.
//!
//! - **The answer is a return value.** [`Arbiter::request`] answers in the
//!   same step, with a lease or a command to leave, so no request goes
//!   unanswered. Only a lease's start is later: its moment `from` is the
//!   arbiter's own deadline.
//! - **One lease at a time, by type.** A request takes the station's
//!   [`LeasePlace`], which comes back with the lease's end or cancellation,
//!   so a station never holds two leases. [`StationNotice`]s name the
//!   lease, so a notice of an earlier lease is never taken for the
//!   current one, and every lease ends in exactly one of
//!   [`StationNotice::LeaseEnded`] or [`StationNotice::LeaseCancelled`].
//! - **A connected station's absence** ([absence decision]) takes its own
//!   token, the [`AbsencePlace`], and names the running primary lease
//!   ([`Arbiter::request_absence`]): it starts a preparation window later,
//!   in which the station tells its access point it leaves (a Null with
//!   PM=1), and only once the station said [`Arbiter::ready`]; one not
//!   ready at its start is cancelled ([`CancelReason::NotReady`]). It
//!   returns to the primary lease's channel, and it ends before the
//!   primary lease does. When the upstream moves the port, the absence is
//!   cancelled ([`CancelReason::Switch`]), and on the [`StationNotice::Moved`]
//!   notice the station exchanges its primary lease for one on the new
//!   channel ([`Arbiter::exchange`]): the old lease goes by value, so two
//!   primary leases never exist at once.
//! - **Order.** The gate closes before every move of the port, so every
//!   terminal of the station's attempts comes before the lease's start and
//!   before its end.
//! - **Time.** The gate starts closing at the lease's `from`, and the lease
//!   starts once it closed and the port moved. Its `until` is the moment
//!   the port is back on the access point's channel: the return starts a
//!   retune earlier, and the station listens only until then
//!   ([`Lease::listen_until`]). A lease whose gate closes too late for two
//!   retunes and the policy's shortest listening before `until` is
//!   cancelled ([`CancelReason::Late`]) ([amendments]).
//! - **Beside an access point**, the station leaves the access point's
//!   channel only in absences after the access point's TBTTs. If the
//!   access point stops during an absence, the lease is cancelled
//!   ([`CancelReason::AccessPointStopped`]) and the port returns.
//! - **A refused move** onto a lease's channel cancels that lease
//!   ([`CancelReason::Refused`]) and the port returns; a failed return, or
//!   a poisoned port, stops the station and the access point
//!   ([`LeaveReason::PortFailed`]).
//! - **The air reservation** is the arbiter's type parameter
//!   ([`ReservationMode`]): an arbiter that reserves the access point's air
//!   for an absence closes the gate with one last frame, a CTS-to-self the
//!   driver sends with the Duration left, and only a phase that sends it
//!   ([`AirReservationPhase`])
//!   closes its gates ([`CloseGateWith`], [reservation decision]).
//! - **The upstream** (the access point the station is connected to) is
//!   the [`coordinator`]'s: the station reports its switch announcements,
//!   its loss and where it found it again ([`UpstreamFact`]); the arbiter
//!   moves the port, announces the access point's own switch, stops and
//!   starts the access point, and tells the station where the port went
//!   ([`StationNotice::Moved`]) or that it must leave.
//! - **A join elsewhere** beside a running access point follows the
//!   [`ApFollowPolicy`] ([follow decision]): the access point announces its
//!   move to the station's channel and the join's lease starts with the
//!   move; one it may not serve stops it, or refuses the join
//!   ([`Refusal::Unservable`]). The announced move is never withdrawn:
//!   after a failed join the access point stays there. Within the follow
//!   interval of its last such move, a join elsewhere is refused with the
//!   moment to retry ([`Refusal::TooSoon`]); the interval doubles after
//!   each failed join that followed a move, up to
//!   [`ApFollowPolicy::max_follow_interval`], and starts again from
//!   [`ApFollowPolicy::min_follow_interval`] once the station connects. A
//!   lease names the access point's channel ([`Lease::access_point`]), so
//!   the station can prefer a candidate there.
//! - **The outbox** holds one cell for each kind of notice and command,
//!   whose capacity the tokens prove: a lease's end carries the one place,
//!   a start needs a lease of it, and a move or a start happens only in a
//!   gate's cycle, before which the owner takes every cell.
//!
//! # Compile-fail tests
//!
//! A phase without the air reservation closes no gate of a reserving
//! arbiter:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0277
//! # use oer_ieee80211_arbiter::{AirReservation, CloseGateWith};
//! # use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::{GateOpen, Ieee80211Instant, LowerMacPhase, PhaseTypes};

//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Its compiling twins: such a phase closes the gates of an arbiter without
//! the reservation, and a phase with it those of a reserving one.
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_ieee80211_arbiter::{AirReservation, CloseGateWith, NoReservation};
