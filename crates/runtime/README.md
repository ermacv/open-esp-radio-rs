# Radio execution

`ieee80211` (`oer-ieee80211-runtime`) holds the chip-independent Wi-Fi
execution primitives (the station service, the lower-MAC owner glue, monitor
handoffs), which no chip runtime uses yet. No Bluetooth LE or IEEE 802.15.4
runtime exists since #770 (tag `legacy-radio-2026-10-16`). Directory
boundaries describe the execution responsibility of each package.

## Execution and time contract

A runtime exposes futures and never spawns, names or requires an executor; any
executor that polls them is valid, and nothing below adapters and compositions
depends on an executor. The portable primitives are
`embassy-sync` (bounded mailboxes and signals over a caller-chosen raw mutex)
and `embassy-futures` (select/join). Time is the [`oer-time`](../time/src/lib.rs)
contract: a runtime reads and waits on time only through an `oer_time::Clock`
or `Timer` value that it owns or receives from its caller, never through
`embassy-time`, which only adapters, compositions and the facade use, dev
dependencies included. Compositions pass
`oer_time_embassy::EmbassyClock`, which reads the one monotonic timebase the
final image links; runtime tests pass the per-instance `VirtualClock` or
`SkipClock` of `oer-time-virtual`. A runtime does not assume which executor
wakes its timers. The portable drivers below the runtime (the `service`
packages under [`services/`](../services/), such as the station join, scan and
lifecycle drivers and the WPA2 handshake runners) take the same `Timer` port
from the runtime, which polls them. The
protocol state machines they drive never wait.

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `ieee80211/src/{monitor,connected_tasks,station_network,stack_boundary}` | Portable capture/injection handoffs, task shutdown, association-scoped network ownership and explicit polling boundary |

Hardware transactions and finite chip state remain below these packages. A
runtime retains their affine owners across borrowed waits, returns the same
resources on rejection and preserves terminal owners when quiescence is not
proven. A composed owner alone does not establish hardware qualification.

The removed BLE and IEEE 802.15.4 runtimes (#770, tag
`legacy-radio-2026-10-16`) returned `ControlFlow` from their disable sinks: a
refused terminal came back by value and stopped delivery, the runtime
published `TerminalRejected` and finished its hardware stop normally, and
uninstall returned `Uninstalled::TerminalsQuarantined` with only the
undelivered terminals, their queue and pending permits quarantined.

The portable Wi-Fi station service uses `MsduQueue` for application commands
as well as network frames. Each queue has one affine sender and receiver;
waiting for readiness borrows its endpoint exclusively without removing a
value. The service handles a ready port event before taking a command, so a
simultaneous port fault leaves that command owned by its queue.

Owned timers follow the owner graph: each runtime carries the clock of its
own deadlines. The platform executor/time ABI remains in
[adapters](../adapters/embassy/README.md).

A chip composition (none exists since #770) chooses memory budgets,
claims static resources and owns protocol lifecycle composition within the
[documented capability boundaries](../hardware/esp32s31/driver/FEATURES.md).
No product composition depends on a second runtime owner hidden in a task or
network handle.

Portable protocol policy cannot depend on this execution domain. The
architecture audit follows transitive normal/build dependencies to enforce
that boundary; portable packages cannot depend on these concrete ESP32-S31
runtimes.
