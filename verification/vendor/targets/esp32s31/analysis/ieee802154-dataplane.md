# ESP32-S31 IEEE 802.15.4 static policy and dataplane boundary

This note extends the lifecycle review with the next source-only slice. Every
finding comes from public ESP-IDF source pinned at commit
`7b9cc1ac79f865983f59bb8ff3ff43eb74ff1dbe`; no vendor binary, disassembly, or
extracted table is an input.

The overall verdict remains **INCOMPLETE**. Static MAC fields, direct frame
storage, RX-buffer ownership, interrupt-source identity, and interrupt dispatch
order are source-confirmed. The repository now additionally has reviewed
read-write W1C semantics for `EVENT_STATUS`, generated affine snapshot
acknowledgement, disjoint task/IRQ PAC owners, a PAC-backed public-LL command
executor, an IRQ port, and a bounded cancellation-safe Embassy handoff. The
verdict remains incomplete because RF/BTBB/coexistence readiness, TX-power
conversion, platform source-132 routing, terminal DMA reclamation and on-air
service composition are not yet joined and qualified.

## 1. Static MAC-policy subset

The public source supports a bounded static policy without claiming the full
vendor PIB:

- channel `11..=26`, converted to the MAC frequency code;
- the four CCA modes and the complete signed `int8_t` threshold domain;
- TX auto-ACK, RX auto-ACK, enhanced-ACK TX, coordinator, promiscuous, and the
  one-bit enhanced-pending projection;
- the primary PAN ID, short address, and eight-byte extended address;
- ACK timeout in 16-microsecond field units.

The public ACK setter computes `(microseconds + 15) / 16`; the getter multiplies
the field by 16. A checked Rust conversion must perform the addition in a wider
integer and reject an input whose rounded result exceeds `u16::MAX`. It must not
reproduce the C `uint32_t` addition overflow at the extreme end of the input
domain.

The extended address is packed little-endian into two words. Each primary
identity setter enables multipan context zero while preserving other context
bits. Readback must compare typed fields, including the context-zero enable
bit, rather than compare complete register images.

The source-backed PIB suborder is frequency, TX power, CCA mode, threshold,
three ACK controls, coordinator, promiscuous, and pending mode. TX power is a
mandatory gap: dBm conversion calls `bt_bb_get_tx_pwr_table()`, whose table is
opaque. The HAL now ports only the public clamp-and-floor scan over an external
non-decreasing level set. It rejects an empty set, a length outside the public
eight-bit domain, or descending values before producing a channel-bound opaque
field code. No ESP32-S31 level values are embedded and no register write is
reachable from that pure resolver. Supplying an arbitrary external slice, or
borrowing it for the lifetime of one resolution, does not prove a provider or
calibration epoch. The provider and its RF/BTBB readiness remain mandatory
gaps: the open static transition can use a deterministic order for the proved
fields and retain the vendor order inside the control subset, but it is not a
complete PIB update and must not write a guessed TX-power code.

All event and abort masks remain zero before, during, and after this static
policy transition. A write fence followed by one typed snapshot provides a
fail-closed publication boundary. A policy-only mismatch retains the preceding
foundation owner for an exact retry; a mask, ED-sampling, or PTI mismatch
invalidates that proof and demotes ownership to the preceding reset state.

## 2. Direct frame-storage contract

This MAC takes one direct 32-bit TX address and one direct 32-bit RX address.
The reviewed operational path does not construct a GDMA descriptor ring for
these transfers. That does not prove every DMA status/configuration register;
only the direct-address contract is required by this slice.

The PHR length is inclusive `3..=127` and includes the two-byte FCS. A fixed
128-byte TX object can therefore represent:

```text
byte 0              PHR = MAC length + 2
bytes 1..PHR-2      MHR and MAC payload
bytes PHR-1..PHR    reserved/zeroed FCS positions; hardware generates FCS
remaining bytes     zeroed, never published as frame content
```

The MAC input length is consequently `1..=125` bytes. The source does not
require software FCS bytes; explicitly reserving and zeroing their positions
prevents stale bytes from becoming observable if a later hardware contract
widens the fetch.

For a valid receive:

```text
byte 0              PHR
bytes 1..PHR-2      MHR and MAC payload, no FCS
byte PHR-1          RSSI code (`i8`)
byte PHR            LQI (`u8`)
```

The whole fixed object fits at the maximum PHR because the last occupied index
is 127. A parser must reject PHR values outside `3..=127` before forming any
slices.

The S31 public memory map declares the half-open interval
`[0x2f00_0000, 0x2f08_0000)` DMA-capable. Address validation must cover the
entire 128-byte object, not only its first byte, and must reject truncation from
`usize` to the 32-bit hardware field. Four-byte alignment is a conservative
open-driver storage invariant, not a newly claimed hardware minimum.

## 3. RX ownership and exhaustion

Every vendor RX slot has a software `process` lease. Hardware may receive into
a slot only while that flag is false; delivery sets it true; the upper layer's
handle-done call validates that the returned pointer belongs to the pool and
releases exactly that slot. Reusing a delivered buffer before release would
violate the public lifetime contract.

When every valid slot is leased, the vendor programs one extra fixed stub
buffer. A frame received there is dropped rather than delivered. A safe pool
therefore needs the explicit path:

```text
Free -> Armed -> Delivered -> Free
                 all busy -> Stub (never delivered)
```

The hardware-address token and the storage lease must be non-forgeable outside
the DMA leaf. A device-ordering fence is required before publishing an armed
buffer and before making completion-visible bytes available to task code.

## 4. IRQ ownership and affine acknowledgement

The peripheral interrupt source is exactly `132`. Both cores have a dedicated
mapping word at route offset `0x210`; the CPU interrupt number occupies bits
`5:0`, and pass/remap level occupies bits `9:8`. Vendor allocation uses flags
zero, so the CPU vector is selected dynamically on the current core and must
not be hard-coded.

Vendor initialization first enables the raw fourteen-bit event image and then
masks timer zero, leaving `0x3eff`. That image still includes unnamed bits 7
and 13 plus named-but-unhandled clock-count-match bit 10. The quiesced open
plan therefore uses the fail-closed intersection `0x3eff & 0x1b7f = 0x1a7f`;
it does not present that safe subset as the exact vendor register image. The
RX/TX abort masks remain the exact reviewed initialization images.

The vendor ISR snapshots event status and both abort reasons, acknowledges the
snapshot, then dispatches in this order:

1. RX-abort phase one;
2. RX SFD, TX SFD, TX done, RX done, ACK TX, ACK RX;
3. RX-abort phase two, TX abort, ED done, timer 0, timer 1;
4. one deferred `next_operation` decision.

That order remains represented and exhaustively tested as pure logic, and the
production path now connects it to a restricted PAC interrupt port. The target
reviewed fact assigns read-write W1C semantics to `EVENT_STATUS`; the published
SVD carries `oneToClear`, and the generated code samples the complete
fourteen-bit field into a non-`Copy` token consumed by acknowledgement. No
caller can supply, narrow, clone, or replay the write image.

The whole-radio PAC route now separates `Ieee802154TaskRegisters` from inactive
`Ieee802154InterruptSetup`. Activation masks delivery, consumes one complete
stale W1C snapshot, publishes the named runtime event mask, and returns a
disjoint `Ieee802154InterruptRegisters` owner. Its hard-IRQ transaction samples
the complete event image plus selected RX/TX abort and ED/CCA sidebands before
consuming the exact W1C token. A production port adapter posts the resulting
non-replayable value to the bounded Embassy queue; task code never receives
status-register authority.

The remaining route gap is platform-specific: no current composition installs,
enables, disables, and tears down CPU source 132 around that prepared owner.
Same-bit arrival and level-line retrigger also still need HIL qualification.
Neither gap reopens the W1C access model or blocks implementation of the task
and IRQ ownership split.

## 5. Strongest honest endpoint

The current implementation supports the following connected software pieces:

```text
FoundationConfigured -> StaticMacPolicyConfigured

TxFrameStoragePrepared
RxPool: Free -> Armed -> Delivered -> Free, with Stub on exhaustion

Ieee802154TaskRegisters -> PAC public-LL command executor -> MacRuntime
Ieee802154InterruptSetup -> affine sample/ack IRQ owner -> Embassy queue

MacRuntime retains the executor and exact RX/TX resources until an
acknowledged batch is accepted by the pure ordered actor

SerializedPolledEdCca -> reusable owner only after the complete consumed W1C
                         snapshot is exactly lone ED_DONE
```

The PAC executor ports static-policy refresh, direct TX/RX address publication,
and RX, TX, CCA-gated TX, standalone CCA, and ED command intents. `STOP` is not
used as a synchronous completion proof. The Embassy owner is cancellation-safe
and fails closed if its bounded acknowledged-event queue overflows.

This is an implemented command/IRQ/DMA architecture, but not yet an operational
radio service. No current constructor joins it with proved PHY, BTBB,
coexistence and CPU-route readiness; terminal DMA reclamation and state-specific
stop policy are incomplete; TX power and on-air behavior remain unqualified.

## Remaining implementation and qualification gates

1. Add the platform source-132 route owner around the existing PAC setup and
   hard-IRQ handler without hard-coding a CPU vector. HIL qualifies delivery,
   teardown, same-bit arrival and retrigger; it does not gate the ownership
   architecture.
2. Compose the task executor and IRQ owner with reviewed PHY, BTBB and
   coexistence-ready owners. Replace or bound `bt_bb_v2_init_cmplx(1)`, PHY
   calibration/wakeup/PLL tracking, `ieee802154_txon_delay_set()`, and the
   TX-power table dependency.
3. Complete terminal RX/TX DMA reclamation and state-specific `STOP`
   reconciliation. Do not publish a new address based only on command issue or
   an unbounded assumption that `STOP` is synchronous.
4. Finish TX-power and timing policy needed by transmit commands.
5. Qualify direct-address alignment and full-range requirements, maximum-length
   RX/TX, and exhausted-pool behavior on real internal SRAM.
6. Exercise ordered multi-event batches, route retrigger, ACK/no-ACK, abort,
   CCA busy/clear, ED, repeated-operation, and recovery paths in HIL.
7. Expose a public asynchronous MAC service only after the remaining software
   owners are composed; require on-air HIL before upgrading qualification, not
   before implementing the source-derived logic.
