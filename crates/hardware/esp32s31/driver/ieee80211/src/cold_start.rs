//! Reusable role-neutral Wi-Fi bring-up as a client of the radio arbiter.
//!
//! This boundary owns the production ordering shared by standalone firmware
//! and HIL, in two halves. The composition that owns the arbiter first
//! prepares the shared PHY (registration, or wake of closed RF) and enables
//! coexistence. [`power_up_esp32s31_wifi`] then enters common radio power and
//! enables the Wi-Fi module clocks and initialized status, and
//! [`start_esp32s31_wifi`] proves the domain ready and enters the Wi-Fi PHY
//! client with its initial tracking, the Wi-Fi RX enable and the initial
//! channel. After a full common-power cycle, Wi-Fi works again only when the
//! RF wake and coexistence precede the repeated power entry (#644). Board
//! token construction and diagnostics remain caller policy.
