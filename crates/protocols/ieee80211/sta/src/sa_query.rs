//! The station's SA Query procedure (IEEE 802.11-2020 11.13).
//!
//! Under management frame protection an unprotected Deauthentication or
//! Disassociation for a class 2 or 3 frame may be forged. The station then
//! asks its access point with protected SA Query Requests whether the
//! association still holds: a matching protected Response ends the procedure
//! and keeps the association, and no Response within the timeout ends the
//! association.
//!
//! The vendor arms a one-shot 1024 ms timeout and a periodic 200 ms retry
//! timer when the procedure starts, draws the first transaction identifier
//! from its random source modulo 65525 and increments it with every further
//! Request. A Response matches any Request sent in the current procedure. A
//! retry after ten Requests also ends the association; with these timers the
//! timeout comes first.
//!
