//! Deterministic virtual time for tests and simulations.
//!
//! [`VirtualClock`] implements [`oer_time::Clock`] and [`oer_time::Timer`]
//! for one instance: time stands still until its owner advances it, so a
//! test or a simulation decides exactly when every wait ends, and several
//! clocks in one process keep independent times. Advancing wakes every
//! pending wait; a wait whose deadline is still ahead registers again when
//! it is polled. There is no global time driver: code that needs time takes
//! a clock.
//!
//! [`SkipClock`] serves code under test that runs on one task and waits only
//! for its own deadlines: each wait moves time to its deadline and ends at
//! once, so a blocking test runs a timed sequence without an executor.
