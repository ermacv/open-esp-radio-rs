//! The S31 connection-event policy and Direct Test Mode notes recovered from
//! the vendor BLE Controller. The radio role that applied them was removed
//! with the Bluetooth LE orchestration (#770, tag `legacy-radio-2026-10-16`).
//!
//! Direct Test Mode, as the vendor runs it:
//! - the test event bodies stop the scheduler
//!   (`r_sym_bt_74l62ZLsZuXg67pPHSd7`), publish the item as the list-zero
//!   head and run it; a test event never enters a running list;
//! - the event bodies disable the route on every test event without CTE
//!   (`r_sym_ble_YpJTETFGhduIAMkkBKjc`); it stays disabled until Test End
//!   reinitializes the PHY;
//! - Test End reinitializes the PHY, which routes the channel again
//!   (`r_ble_phy_init`);
//! - the vendor ends a test by stopping the scheduler rather than cancelling
//!   its running event (`sym_dtm_NsbldBIeGraE2wg0AVy7`).

// Source-owned S31 connection-event policy. The provenance of each term is
// the recurring-event section of
// docs/vendor/esp32s31/bluetooth-peripheral-connection.md:
// the 16-us widening jitter is the Controller configuration's default
// `ble_ll_jitter_usecs`, the 10-us receive guard is the private-options
// default, the 2-us receive tail and the 1-us boundary are CPU-time ticks, and
// 1,074 us is the minimum LE 1M event duration. A recurring event ends
// 1,074 us after its widened anchor less the preparation lead; the first
// event ends 1,074 us plus the boundary after its transmit window, with the
// 16-us first-event uncertainty on each side.
