# Platform HIL diagnostics

## Platform reset and watchdog

`GetBootStatus` returns `BootEvidence` for the boot identified by the envelope.
`ResetReason` is a platform value shared by all images: software reset, MWDT1
reset or another cause; querying it does not change radio state. `BootEvidence::platform_panic` is the
record the platform's panic entry left (`panic::take_previous`, taken once
per boot): the panic's hart, whether it ran on the interrupt stack and the
interrupted PC, and the end of its file path, line and column.

`system::InjectPanic` is served only by the panic-reset image, whose panic
entry has no HIL report: the image acknowledges with `PanicInjected` and
panics in thread context, the entry records the panic and resets the chip
through `esp_hal::system::software_reset`, and the next boot reports a
software reset and the record.

`system::DisableUsb` is served only by the `diagnostic-usb-jtag-off` image
(the system watchdog image with the agent's `usb-jtag-off` feature): it
acknowledges with `UsbDisabled`, then drops the USB Serial/JTAG's D+ and D-
pull-ups and takes it off its pads. Off its pads alone, the device stops
answering but the host keeps it enumerated; without the pull-up the host sees
it disconnect. Only a reset of the chip brings it back. The host arms
`SerialCapture::expect_detach` before the request, so the end of the stream
that follows closes the capture without a failure.

`system::WatchdogTest` is served only by the dedicated watchdog image.
The dedicated radio-free image's one-second engineering budget exercises completion, a synchronous
poll that never returns, cancellation, missing completion and late restoration
of the SoC deadline service. The correlated event acknowledges the selected
mode; only `Complete` acknowledges disarming. Other modes must produce a new
boot and MWDT1 reset reason. This does not inject a PHY failure or measure RF
cessation.

## Program-counter profile

No image samples the program counter: the sampler (`pc-profile`) and its
agent modules were deleted (#762, tag `legacy-wifi-2026-10-16`). The `telemetry` profile
messages (`ProfileControl`, `ProfileStatus`, `GetProfileSamples`) remain in
the protocol with no producer.

Sampling perturbs timing: a profiled run is diagnostic evidence, never a
throughput or timing measurement.

## Stack measurements

`StackUsage` carries task watermarks and optional dedicated IRQ watermarks for
both harts; a network session's evidence reports it. A hart that runs no
executor reports `None`. Images with shared task/IRQ stacks report `None` for
both dedicated IRQ fields.

IRQ sampling runs in thread mode with local interrupts masked during the SRAM
scan. It therefore adds a short interruption to RF servicing; these diagnostic
runs are not a timing baseline with instrumentation removed. The image's stack
policy supplies the nonzero required reserve. These are observed boot-lifetime
watermarks, not worst-case bounds or evidence of every possible nested IRQ.
