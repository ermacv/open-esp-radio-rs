//! The chips this repository supports, from their tracked profiles.
//!
//! Every supported chip has `platform/<id>/chip.toml`, holding only what
//! differs between chips and cannot be derived from the id: the chip family,
//! the Rust target, the boot flow, the chip name `espflash` uses, the silicon revisions and
//! the chip's properties (radio bands, Bluetooth modes, cores).
//! Everything else follows the id by convention (`verification/<id>`,
//! `registers/<id>`, `hil/targets/<id>`, `qualification/targets/<id>`,
//! `target/hil/<id>`), and a capability exists where its directory does.
//! Host tools resolve a chip through [`Profile::load`] instead of matching
//! chip names, so an unknown chip is refused with the supported ones.
