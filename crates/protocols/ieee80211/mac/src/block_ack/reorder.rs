//! The receive reorder buffer of one Block Ack agreement.
//!
//! IEEE Std 802.11-2020 10.25.6 makes the recipient of a Block Ack
//! agreement release MSDUs to the upper layer in sequence order. Reordering
//! is software above the lower-MAC port unless a backend reports
//! `HardwareServices::RX_REORDER`. [`RxReorderBuffer`] is that software: it
//! holds the window of one agreement and decides which buffered MPDUs a
//! received MPDU, a BlockAckReq, a gap timeout or a teardown releases.
//!
//! The buffer never holds frame bytes. Every retained MPDU is a checked
//! caller-chosen slot index ([`RxReorderMpdu::slot`]) into the caller's own
//! frame storage; the caller recycles every slot a [`RxReorderRelease`]
//! returns. The buffer never reads time: the caller decides when a gap has
//! waited long enough and calls [`RxReorderBuffer::expire_gap`].
//!
//! `WINDOW_CAPACITY` bounds the negotiated window (at most
//! [`MAX_RX_REORDER_WINDOW`], the width of the occupancy bitmap) and sizes
//! the retained-MPDU table; `SLOT_CAPACITY` is the size of the caller's slot
//! domain. A backend whose memory profile needs a smaller window chooses a
//! smaller `WINDOW_CAPACITY`.
