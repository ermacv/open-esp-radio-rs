//! A scenario's one purpose, as a type.
//!
//! The purpose is a marker type of [`Spec::Purpose`](crate::Spec::Purpose),
//! so the executor can admit a scenario by its purpose at compile time: the
//! host model executes only conformance scenarios, because interop and
//! measurement need real peers and real hardware. There is deliberately no
//! protocol purpose: protocol behaviour is proven on the host against the
//! model, and a stand scenario that only repeats it cannot name one.
