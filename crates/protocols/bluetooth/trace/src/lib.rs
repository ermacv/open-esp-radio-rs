//! Trace points of the Bluetooth LE Controller, the ESP32-S31 radio role
//! and its runtime.
//!
//! Every event they record into [`oer_trace`] is defined here with its
//! channel in `Domain::Bluetooth`, so the host decodes a drained record with
//! the same type. One channel gates one event, so a session can leave the
//! per-PDU reports off while it records the connection's steps. The
//! channels and where each event is emitted are listed in this crate's
//! README.
