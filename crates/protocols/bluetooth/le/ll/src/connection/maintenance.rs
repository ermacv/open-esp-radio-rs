//! Protocol admission for a budgeted maintenance-induced event pause.
//!
//! This policy accompanies the actual connection owner. It neither grants RF
//! access nor admits elapsed-time budgets. The chip scheduler must separately
//! check fresh time, supervision/procedure margins, physical quiescence and
//! restoration before the unchanged successor anchor.
//!
//! Core 6.2 Vol 6 Part B, §§4.5.5 and 5.5.1 require initial acknowledgement
//! and confirmation of acknowledgement for a pending Instant indication.
//! Peer SN advance supplies the latter confirmation. The maintenance policy
//! protects the Instant event and its predecessor for both supported Instant
//! procedures; the predecessor restriction for Channel Map Update is an OER
//! admission invariant, not an additional Bluetooth requirement.
//! See the [Link Layer specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Files/Specification/HTML/Core-62/out/en/low-energy-controller/link-layer-specification.html).
