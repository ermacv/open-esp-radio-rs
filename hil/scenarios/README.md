# Versioned scenario catalog

Folders identify the workload domain: system. No IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth,
IEEE 802.15.4, coexistence or PHY scenario exists: they were deleted with the
images they ran on (#762, tag `legacy-wifi-2026-10-16`; #770, tag
`legacy-radio-2026-10-16`) and return with the HIL architecture of #761.
Scenario IDs are stable across folder moves. Tags select overlapping
diagnostic and characterization uses; they do not assign ownership or make a
hardware-readiness claim.

## Roles

Every document declares its `role`. A `qualification` scenario is one that a
[qualification program](../../qualification/README.md) references; every other
scenario is an `investigation` scenario: the catalog of diagnostics,
measurements and experiments no program requires. The role is derived, never
chosen: validating any program fails while a `qualification` scenario is
referenced by no program, and a requirement on an `investigation` scenario can
never be satisfied (its obligation reports `requirement-names-investigation-scenario`).
A scenario on a diagnostic image class (`diagnostic-*`), or one that requests a
profile, must be an `investigation` scenario and may not carry the
`performance` tag: observers and probes the product does not carry never
qualify it or shape a gated figure. `cargo hil run-all --role qualification`
runs every qualification scenario.

## Document shape

Schema 5 documents have a common header and exactly one family table:

```toml
schema = 5
id = "boot-smoke"
description = "..."
role = "investigation"          # or "qualification"; see Roles
repetitions = 3                 # default 1
tags = ["smoke"]
unsupported = "..."             # optional; see Unsupported scenarios

[system]
kind = "boot-smoke"
```

The family owns every executable value:

- `[system]` is a tagged workload whose kind implies the firmware image.
Every table rejects unknown fields. Relations that remain between the image,
the data path and the workload are validated by the family.

## Chips

A scenario names no chip. It runs on every chip whose HIL agent builds its
image class: the esp32s31, whose staged boot flow builds every class its
runtime declares, and a chip the ESP-IDF bootloader starts whose
`platform/<chip>/chip.toml` names its flash layout and whose
`hil/targets/<chip>` runtime declares the class's features (the esp32c5
builds `boot-smoke` and `system-watchdog`). A run takes the chip
`cargo hil run --chip CHIP` names, or the only chip that builds every selected
image; when several can, it refuses and names them. It uses that chip's device
under test from the stand file.

## Stand claims

A run claims the boards and fixtures its scenarios require and the frequency
ranges their radio work occupies. The range follows the family: system
scenarios occupy the 2.4 GHz band, and the radio-free watchdog none. By default a
scenario tolerates other protocol traffic in its range and transmits
normally. Tags change that:

| Tag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `air-strict` | No other transmitter may use its range: RF levels, noise, sensitivity, A/B throughput |
| `air-noisy` | It transmits without regard for others: a continuous carrier, no CSMA, DTM, a throughput flood |
| `air-exclusive` | Both of the above |

Two runs conflict only where their ranges overlap: a strict run excludes any
transmission there, and a tolerant one excludes a noisy transmitter. Work on
disjoint ranges, or without a radio, runs in parallel. Every run records the
ranges it held, their level and the other leases held at its grant in
`air.json`. Tags are excluded from scenario digests, so adding a tag does not
invalidate recorded evidence.

## Named checks

Named checks are derived from implemented workload behavior and explicit
criteria, not tags. Qualification can
require these observations by name without duplicating their thresholds.
`cargo hil plan --proof NAME` filters candidates. It never fills in missing
observations from a suite PASS.

Both the runner and the independent qualification evaluator discover regular
TOML files recursively. The filename stem must equal the document ID. IDs are
unique throughout the catalog. README.md is the only ignored documentation
filename. Symlinks (including a symlink catalog root), special files, other
file extensions and an empty catalog are rejected. One discovery,
`oer_hil_scenario::catalog::documents`, never follows directory links outside
the catalog and checks every header (schema, id, repetition bounds) and the
single family table for both readers; only the runner interprets executable
workload and acceptance fields, and the qualification evaluator keeps each
document as a value.

The runner sorts by scenario ID.
`run-all` first traverses `ImageClass::ALL`, then the selected
scenarios of each image in catalog order. Folder traversal order cannot change
physical execution order. Each TOML document owns its image features,
workload criteria and repetition count.

Synthetic serialized compatibility inputs live in `hil/tests/fixtures/catalog`.
Both readers' tests use them; they are not part of this catalog.

## Program-counter profile

An optional top-level `[profile]` table (`harts = "both" | "core0" |
"core1"`, `period-us` in 100..=100000) samples the program counter of the
image's harts during the workload's measured window. The sampler (`pc-profile`)
was deleted (#762, tag `legacy-wifi-2026-10-16`), so the runner refuses every profile request;
when a class samples again, only
an `investigation` scenario without the `performance` tag may request it:
sampling perturbs timing. The table is part of the procedure, so a profiled scenario
is a different scenario from its unprofiled copy, and its evidence never
stands in for a throughput or timing measurement.

## Unsupported scenarios

The optional top-level `unsupported` field states why the current firmware
cannot run a scenario: no image it builds serves the workload's image class,
or the class's image does not declare a role the workload drives. The runner
refuses an explicitly named unsupported scenario before building any image;
a tag or run-all selection skips it and prints its id and reason once. A
qualification requirement on it stays open, and `cargo qualification next`
shows the reason. The field is not part of the executed procedure, so
recorded evidence stays comparable. The runner's catalog test fails when a
marked scenario is served, or an unmarked one is not, by the image classes
declared in `hil/targets/esp32s31/agent/Cargo.toml` and their declared
capabilities; after flashing, the runner checks the same roles against the
capabilities the image reports.
