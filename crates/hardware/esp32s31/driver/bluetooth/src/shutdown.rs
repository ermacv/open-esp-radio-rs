//! Shutdown of a stopped Controller epoch.
//!
//! The composition first stops the radio runtime, drains the source-127
//! task and removes the CPU routes; it then recovers the interrupt output and
//! the ready timer owner from stable ISR storage. [`retire`] releases the
//! Controller output and leaves the shared PHY domain and BTBB, as the
//! vendor Controller disable runs `esp_phy_disable(PHY_MODEM_BT)` before its
//! deinit; the radio system then closes RF if Bluetooth was the last client.
//! [`ControllerRetired::shut_down`] finally resets the Controller domains and
//! returns the clocked client with the BLE PHY allocations, which no hardware
//! references after the reset.
