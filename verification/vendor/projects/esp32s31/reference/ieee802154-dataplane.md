# ESP32-S31 IEEE 802.15.4 static policy and dataplane contracts

This reference describes public ESP-IDF source contracts pinned at commit
`7b9cc1ac79f865983f59bb8ff3ff43eb74ff1dbe`. Source order, software state and
hardware readiness are distinct claims. Reviewed register semantics belong to
[the register model](../../../../../registers/esp32s31/README.md); production
implementation and qualification retain their own authority.

## 1. Static MAC-policy subset

The public source supports a bounded static policy without claiming the full
vendor PIB:

- channel `11..=26`, converted to the MAC frequency code;
- the four CCA modes and the complete signed `int8_t` threshold domain;
- TX auto-ACK, RX auto-ACK, enhanced-ACK TX, coordinator, promiscuous, and the
  one-bit enhanced-pending projection;
- the primary PAN ID, short address, and eight-byte extended address;
- ACK timeout in 16-microsecond field units.

The public ACK setter computes `(microseconds + 15) / 16`; the getter multiplies
the field by 16. A checked Rust conversion must perform the addition in a wider
integer and reject an input whose rounded result exceeds `u16::MAX`. It must not
reproduce the C `uint32_t` addition overflow at the extreme end of the input
domain.

The extended address is packed little-endian into two words. Each primary
identity setter enables multipan context zero while preserving other context
bits. Readback must compare typed fields, including the context-zero enable
bit, rather than compare complete register images.

The source-backed PIB suborder is frequency, TX power, CCA mode, threshold,
three ACK controls, coordinator, promiscuous, and pending mode. TX power is a
mandatory gap: dBm conversion calls `bt_bb_get_tx_pwr_table()`, whose table is
opaque. The HAL ports only the public clamp-and-floor scan over an external
non-decreasing level set. It rejects an empty set, a length outside the public
eight-bit domain, or descending values before producing a channel-bound opaque
field code. No ESP32-S31 level values are embedded and no register write is
reachable from that pure resolver. Supplying an arbitrary external slice, or
borrowing it for the lifetime of one resolution, does not prove a provider or
calibration epoch. The provider and its RF/BTBB readiness remain mandatory
gaps: the open static transition can use a deterministic order for the proved
fields and retain the vendor order inside the control subset, but it is not a
complete PIB update and must not write a guessed TX-power code.

All event and abort masks remain zero before, during, and after this static
policy transition. A write fence followed by one typed snapshot provides a
fail-closed publication boundary. A policy-only mismatch retains the preceding
foundation owner for an exact retry; a mask, ED-sampling, or PTI mismatch
invalidates that proof and demotes ownership to the preceding reset state.

## 2. Direct frame-storage contract

This MAC takes one direct 32-bit TX address and one direct 32-bit RX address.
The reviewed operational path does not construct a GDMA descriptor ring for
these transfers. That does not prove every DMA status/configuration register;
only the direct-address contract is required by this slice.

The PHR length is inclusive `3..=127` and includes the two-byte FCS. A fixed
128-byte TX object can therefore represent:

```text
byte 0              PHR = MAC length + 2
bytes 1..PHR-2      MHR and MAC payload
bytes PHR-1..PHR    reserved/zeroed FCS positions; hardware generates FCS
remaining bytes     zeroed, never published as frame content
```

The MAC input length is consequently `1..=125` bytes. The source does not
require software FCS bytes; explicitly reserving and zeroing their positions
prevents stale bytes from becoming observable if a later hardware contract
widens the fetch.

For a valid receive:

```text
byte 0              PHR
bytes 1..PHR-2      MHR and MAC payload, no FCS
byte PHR-1          RSSI code (`i8`)
byte PHR            LQI (`u8`)
```

The whole fixed object fits at the maximum PHR because the last occupied index
is 127. A parser must reject PHR values outside `3..=127` before forming any
slices.

The S31 public memory map declares the half-open interval
`[0x2f00_0000, 0x2f08_0000)` DMA-capable. Address validation must cover the
entire 128-byte object, not only its first byte, and must reject truncation from
`usize` to the 32-bit hardware field. Four-byte alignment is a conservative
open-driver storage invariant, not a newly claimed hardware minimum.

## 3. RX ownership and exhaustion

Every vendor RX slot has a software `process` lease. Hardware may receive into
a slot only while that flag is false; delivery sets it true; the upper layer's
handle-done call validates that the returned pointer belongs to the pool and
releases exactly that slot. Reusing a delivered buffer before release would
violate the public lifetime contract.

When every valid slot is leased, the vendor programs one extra fixed stub
buffer. A frame received there is dropped rather than delivered. A safe pool
therefore needs the explicit path:

```text
Free -> Armed -> Delivered -> Free
                 all busy -> Stub (never delivered)
```

The hardware-address token and the storage lease must be non-forgeable outside
the DMA leaf. A device-ordering fence is required before publishing an armed
buffer and before making completion-visible bytes available to task code.

## 4. IRQ ownership and affine acknowledgement

The peripheral interrupt source is exactly `132`. Both cores have a dedicated
mapping word at route offset `0x210`; the CPU interrupt number occupies bits
`5:0`, and pass/remap level occupies bits `9:8`. Vendor allocation uses flags
zero, so the CPU vector is selected dynamically on the current core and must
not be hard-coded.

Vendor initialization first enables the raw fourteen-bit event image and then
masks timer zero, leaving `0x3eff`. That image still includes unnamed bits 7
and 13 plus named-but-unhandled clock-count-match bit 10. The quiesced open
plan therefore uses the fail-closed intersection `0x3eff & 0x1b7f = 0x1a7f`;
it does not present that safe subset as the exact vendor register image. The
RX/TX abort masks remain the exact reviewed initialization images.

The vendor ISR snapshots event status and both abort reasons, acknowledges the
snapshot, then dispatches in this order:

1. RX-abort phase one;
2. RX SFD, TX SFD, TX done, RX done, ACK TX, ACK RX;
3. RX-abort phase two, TX abort, ED done, timer 0, timer 1;
4. one deferred `next_operation` decision.

That order remains represented and exhaustively tested as pure logic, and the
production path connects it to a restricted PAC interrupt port. The target
reviewed fact assigns read-write W1C semantics to `EVENT_STATUS`; the published
SVD carries `oneToClear`, and the generated code samples the complete
fourteen-bit field into a non-`Copy` token consumed by acknowledgement. No
caller can supply, narrow, clone, or replay the write image.

The whole-radio PAC route separates `Ieee802154TaskRegisters` from inactive
`Ieee802154InterruptSetup`. Activation masks delivery, consumes one complete
stale W1C snapshot, publishes the named runtime event mask, and returns a
disjoint `Ieee802154InterruptRegisters` owner. Its hard-IRQ transaction samples
the complete event image plus selected RX/TX abort and ED/CCA sidebands before
consuming the exact W1C token. A production port adapter posts the resulting
non-replayable value to the bounded Embassy queue; task code never receives
status-register authority.
The platform adapter owns source-132 routing and its teardown around the
prepared interrupt owner. Same-bit arrival and level-line retrigger are
hardware qualification questions; neither changes the W1C access contract.

## Ownership boundary

Frame storage remains pinned while hardware owns its direct address. The
control runtime retains RX/TX owners until an accepted acknowledged batch
authorizes reclamation. The IRQ owner alone samples and acknowledges status;
the bounded async handoff carries values, not PAC capabilities or raw DMA
addresses. Queue overflow fails closed. `STOP` is not synchronous completion
evidence. Whole-radio readiness belongs to composed PHY/BTBB/coexistence,
platform and MAC owners and to the qualification specification.
