//! One installation, one body and one independently owned driver.
//!
//! `Installed` moves its backend and driver into `run_port` once. The static
//! `drive` signature consumes a closed affine `DriverLoan` and its retire
//! receiver; its future borrows the driver without borrowing the backend.
//! Both owners remain in `run_port`. The backend is lent by
//! `&mut` to the body's owner. Consuming transitions transfer that same loan.
//!
//! The driver has no installation lifetime. All branded queues (`Slot<'id>`,
//! in-flight owners and their terminal capacity) live in `Held<'id>`; `drive`
//! receives a shared borrow. `Local<'id>` belongs only to the body. The phase
//! and setup are invariant loans, and cannot outlive an owner transition.
//! Hardware-reachable backing has static storage and never resides inline
//! in the movable driver or its future. Cancelling the drive future ends
//! only its loan. Quarantine retains the backend, driver and completion
//! state without running any of their destructors, even if its receipt is
//! dropped; only ordinary uninstall receives reusable owners.
//!
//! A driver returns either a retirement proof obtained after the core's
//! request, or a poison proof obtained by publishing a fault. A faulted
//! driver's state is retained while the body drains earlier results and
//! returns `Ended`. Uninstall consumes `Retired` and `Detached` of the same
//! installation. A missed retirement deadline is a fail-stop.
//!
//! Dropping an owner wakes the core through `AbandonLatch`. The core drops
//! the body, poisons the installation through `abandon`, requests asynchronous
//! retirement, and detaches after the driver ends. Cancelling `run_port`
//! poisons synchronously as a safety net; it cannot await teardown.
//! Forgetting an owner cannot construct `Ended`: the core still owns the
//! backend, and cancellation still abandons it. Neither path needs a panic.
