//! A board's resets: the USB Serial/JTAG openers and reset sequences, and
//! [`climb`], the one ladder of a board's ways back that every recovery and
//! `cargo hil board reset` take.
//!
//! The rungs are the board's stand-file `reset` steps in their order: an RTS
//! pulse on its USB Serial/JTAG port, a system reset through its builtin
//! USB-JTAG with OpenOCD, and its hub port's power. After them, a board that
//! resets by power can be put into the ROM's download mode: its port is
//! powered off and on and, as soon as its USB returns, reset into download
//! through the USB Serial/JTAG, before a flashed image that switches the
//! USB Serial/JTAG off runs. A ROM in download mode serves the USB
//! Serial/JTAG, so the stand can load firmware into the board.
