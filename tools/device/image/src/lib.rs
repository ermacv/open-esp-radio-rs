//! What a board's flash holds, as the devices layer knows it, and the one
//! operation that changes it.
//!
//! [`write()`] is the only writer of a board's flash on the host: `cargo fw`
//! (through `oer-devices`) and the stand's boards (through
//! `oer-stand-board`, which HIL flashes with) both call it. Under the
//! board's [`DeviceAccess`] it
//!
//! 1. reads the bundle's flash contents **once** into owned bytes (its
//!    [`Snapshot`], verified against the manifest) and computes the
//!    [`Receipt`] of the **whole** snapshot: the SHA-256 of every segment
//!    (bootloader, partition table, application, OTA selection) at its
//!    offset, and one digest over them all;
//! 2. invalidates the board's known image ([`State::Writing`]) **before**
//!    any byte of flash changes, so an interrupted or failed write leaves no
//!    stale claim, and takes the board's next write **generation**;
//! 3. writes the same snapshot (espflash over USB, or OpenOCD over JTAG
//!    from a private directory the snapshot is materialized in);
//! 4. publishes [`State::Written`] with the receipt and its generation.
//!
//! The image then still has to start; the caller starts it as its
//! [`Written::pending_start`] says and confirms it with [`Written::started`],
//! which publishes [`State::Started`]. "Written" and "started successfully"
//! are distinct states.
//!
//! [`DeviceAccess`] is cloneable, so two writes in one process may
//! interleave; the generation orders them. Every write takes the next
//! generation of its board in the store, and a commit (the `Written` after
//! the flash, the `Started` of [`Written::started`]) succeeds only while
//! the board's state is still the one its own write left, with its
//! generation: a confirmation that a later write overtook fails as a stale
//! write. Each read-and-replace of a state holds the process's commit lock;
//! across processes the board's device lock serializes them.
//!
//! Whether a board already carries a bundle, so a flash may be skipped, is
//! decided by [`carries`] from this store alone (a board journal is history
//! and never decides it), in one read: only a board whose state is
//! `Started` with the bundle's digest carries it, and that receipt is the
//! answer. No identity is read back from the board:
//! reading the flash's checksums needs the ROM's download mode, which
//! resets the image a skip would keep; the receipt is the best knowledge
//! short of that. Any write that bypasses this crate, or any process
//! writing the flash without the board's device lock, voids the receipt.
//!
//! The receipts are one JSON file per board in the XDG data directory
//! (`devices/<MAC>.image.json`), replaced atomically and read strictly: a
//! file that does not parse is an error, never "unknown, so carried". A
//! receipt of another schema carries nothing, and the next write replaces
//! it.
