//! Comparison of the RX-ring recycle with `wDev_AppendRxBlocks`.
//!
//! The vendor returns a completed descriptor unit to its receive list in one
//! call: it rearms every descriptor of the unit and resets its buffer guards,
//! links the unit after the list's tail, rings the append doorbell and polls
//! it, then repairs the descriptor base when the walker already stopped at
//! the old tail. Production does the same through its ring owner's recycle
//! and reload completion. Both sides hold the ring at the addresses of the
//! production probe's DMA arena, which its layout entry reports; each case
//! completes the ring's first descriptors as one unit and compares the
//! doorbell, cursor and base register effects, the descriptors and the
//! unit's buffer guards.
