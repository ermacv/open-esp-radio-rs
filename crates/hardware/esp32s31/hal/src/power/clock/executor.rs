//! Target executor for the shared modem clock planner.
//!
//! The planner decides which dependency edges a module request needs; this
//! executor performs each edge and only then records it complete. Modem gates
//! go to the radio PAC. The upstream 160 MHz source and the analog-I2C master
//! clock belong to the platform clock owner and are reached through
//! [`PlatformClockProvider`], which counts its own references.
//!
//! The coexistence gate shares its register word with the analog-I2C master,
//! so it is a platform-owned half too.
//!
//! For the modem PLL-source dependency the executor acquires the 160 MHz
//! source before opening the modem gate and releases it after closing the
//! gate, in the vendor order. Each platform reference lives in
//! [`ModemPlatformClocks`] while its dependency is enabled. A refused request
//! poisons the transaction: the planner cannot tell a refused request from a
//! partially applied one.
