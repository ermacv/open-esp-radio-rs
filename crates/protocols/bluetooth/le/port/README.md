# Bluetooth LE radio port lifecycle

`oer-bluetooth-port` is the lifecycle of the Bluetooth LE radio port, which the Bluetooth LE block owns
(#709): `PortBackend`, which `LeRadioBackend` (`oer-bluetooth-radio`) extends; `run_port`, which runs a
`PortBody` over a just-installed backend joined with the backend's driver
and takes the backend apart after the body's uninstall; the `Owner` in its
`Disabled` and `Enabled` states, `Failed`, `PoisonedOwner` and `Ended`;
a running phase's `PhaseParts`, each a `Lent` of the owner's borrow;
`Work` and the `RadioPortEvents`/`RadioPortClient` traits; `CancelError`
and `ClockError`. The block's lifecycle enums and correlation identities
live here too. Every rule a caller controls is a type, each with a
compile-fail test in the crate documentation.

The vocabulary the blocks share (the brand and `Mint`, slots, permits and
seats, `PortResult`, `Poisoned`, `EventsLost` and the clock relation)
is `oer-radio-port`'s.

The shared factory preserves a sealed component path through nested pool
layouts, independently of the installation brand. BLE backends with no
capacity layout use `()`; a standalone slot layout has `Root`, while tuple
components retain their distinct child paths in the backend's resources.
The existing port lifecycle introduces no path erasure or extra runtime
storage.
