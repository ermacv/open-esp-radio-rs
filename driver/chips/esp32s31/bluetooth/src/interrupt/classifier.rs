//! Evidence-bounded classification of the primary Bluetooth MAC IRQ suffix.
//!
//! The restricted PAC owns the exact masked-status sample and W1C prefix.
//! This module first rejects the four baseline groups consumed by the complete
//! assertion prefix, then classifies the three dynamic source groups consumed
//! by the source-124 scheduler suffix. Raw status and diagnostic images remain
//! inside the PAC; this layer receives positional source facts only.
//!
//! The reference handler can observe `SCHEDULER_STATE` twice: once while
//! handling bank-one source 3 and again while constructing scheduler work.
//! Distinct input types preserve those two temporal positions. A future hard
//! handler must obtain each observation at its named point; it must not reuse
//! one register image for both merely because their bit geometry is equal.
