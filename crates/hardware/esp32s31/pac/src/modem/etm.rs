//! Channel-disjoint capabilities over the modem event-task matrix.
//!
//! IEEE 802.15.4 programs channels zero and one, the Bluetooth PHY
//! initialization channel two and the Bluetooth runtime channels four through
//! seven. The channel-enable set and clear words are
//! write-trigger — writing 1 acts on one channel and writing 0 has no effect,
//! as in the ESP32-S31 SoC ETM of identical layout; this is not yet verified
//! on the modem ETM hardware. Each capability therefore writes only its own
//! bits and never reads a trigger word, so the two protocols need no lock,
//! and IEEE 802.15.4 may use its channels from its interrupt handler.
