//! Finite execution-lock sequence from the reviewed common-library body.
//!
//! SOURCE: pinned `libbtdm_common.a` member `18.o`
//! `r_sym_bt_9H3AnHbaHJ3auzSvPDme` (the `r_btdm_sched_execution_lock`
//! role). It first runs the idle preamble `r_sym_bt_B8fDByebTHuwRe8FZuRt`,
//! which returns once the scheduler is idle or both command engines report
//! idle, then publishes command zero and observes it until the scheduler is
//! idle or command zero reports its result. The vendor polls inside one
//! critical section; here every step is finite, serialized with interrupt
//! service, and the caller owns the deadline.
