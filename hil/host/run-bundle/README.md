# HIL run bundle

`oer-hil-run-bundle` owns the format of a HIL run bundle, its one writer and
its one reader; every producer and consumer of a run, the qualification
evaluator included, goes through it.

| Module | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `run` | The typed documents (manifest, plan, suite, scenario and repetition results with their measurements (name, value, unit, `semantics` version, declared `better` direction, threshold, verdict; `MetricId` is their identity), the cleanup and USB records of a repetition, the integrity index and the scenario seals), the writer `RunSession` (create, bind sources and firmware, seal a scenario, finish, mark interrupted), `integrity` (the seal and its one verification, every file hashed again) and `validation` (the structural rules writer and readers share) |
| `read` | `RunBundle::open`, the typed reader: manifest, plan, suite, events, scenario documents and results, cleanup and USB records, lab and build provenance, the verified integrity seal and scenario seals, the runner's checkout, liveness |
| `store` | `RunStore`: the store every checkout shares (`$OER_HIL_STORE`, else `<XDG data>/open-esp-radio/hil`) with `runs/`, the observer builds, the sidecars (pins, quarantine, performance baselines, caches) and a checkout's link `target/hil/runs`; `store::pending`, the checkout's pending evidence |
| `receipt` | `OER_HIL_RUN_RECEIPT`, the receipt a runner names the runs it creates in, and `RunId` |
| `build` | The build provenance of a run's images and the content-addressed object store: the one definition of a build's identity, which the image builder fills; it archives the runtime ELF deflate-compressed |
| `archived` | How a bundle keeps an archived file: the runtime ELF deflate-compressed at `<path>.deflate` (recorded by its uncompressed path, size and digest), every other file as it is; `read_archived` and `archived_identity`, the one reader every consumer goes through |
| `verify` | Offline verification of whole bundles (`cargo hil report verify`) and of a replay source against the image builder's recipe |
| `experiment`, `lab` | The A/B experiment and the laboratory cell a run records |

Every document of a bundle carries a schema version (`RUN_SCHEMA`, the
scenario seal's `ATTEMPT_SEAL_SCHEMA`, `LAB_PROVENANCE_SCHEMA`,
`BUILD_PROVENANCE_SCHEMA`, `OBSERVATIONS_SCHEMA`, the source snapshot's
`MANIFEST_SCHEMA`). `format/tests/schema/run-schema-<RUN_SCHEMA>/` holds one
document of each kind with its optional parts present, the fixture records of
`run::fixtures` included (`helper.json` wraps a family's own type and is the
family's to keep readable), and
`format/tests/schema.rs` reads each back unchanged: a change a stored bundle
would not survive (a new required field, a renamed, removed or retyped one)
fails there and needs a schema bump, with those documents moved to the new
schema's directory and brought to the new shape. A new optional field that
defaults when absent needs none.

The JUnit and HTML views a run seals are rendered by `oer-hil-analysis`,
which the runner hands `RunSession::finish`. The bundle depends on no
stand, board or image builder code.

```console
cargo test -p oer-hil-run-bundle
