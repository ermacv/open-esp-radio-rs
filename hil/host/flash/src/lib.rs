//! The HIL flash operation, how a run writes a board's flash:
//!
//! 1. **lease**: the target is a leased board ([`oer_stand_board::LeasedBoard`]),
//!    which holds the board's device access: the arbiter's grant takes it
//!    for every leased board;
//! 2. **write**: the devices layer's one write operation
//!    (`oer-device-image`) invalidates the board's receipt, writes the image
//!    bundle's segments, publishes the receipt of the whole bundle, starts
//!    the image as the chip profile's `[flash] start` says and confirms the
//!    start;
//! 3. **journal**: the board journal records the flash as history
//!    ([`Journal::record_flash`]); it never decides whether a board carries
//!    an image.
//!
//! [`flash_if_changed`] skips a board whose receipt says it runs the whole
//! bundle. The runner's flash of the device under test and of the reference
//! peers, and the calibration capture call [`flash`] or
//! [`flash_if_changed`]; [`catalog`] flashes an ESP-IDF catalog image.
