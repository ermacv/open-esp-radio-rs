//! An in-memory lower-MAC backend on the phase shape
//! (`oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::phase`), for host tests of the shape and of
//! the code that drives it.
//!
//! [`ModelBackend::new`] takes the install's channel and interface
//! addresses and returns the backend, which a test hands to
//! [`run_port`](oer_radio_port::run_port), and the [`ModelAir`] it
//! plays on: the air answers each transmission, delivers received frames
//! and records what the hardware saw. Receive Block Ack agreements are
//! per-slot desired state: updates coalesce before the driver applies them,
//! without occupying the command queue. Configure and TSF sampling consume
//! their affine permissions in the FIFO; their terminals return those same
//! permissions, including through disable's drain.
//!
//! The backend has the phase's shape ([owner decisions on #563]): the phase
//! is the body's handle over queues to the model's driver
//! (`PortBackend::drive`), which alone owns the model's hardware (its
//! queues of prepared attempts, its key table, its receive rules). The
//! handle writes commands, in one queue and in order, and setting cells;
//! the driver takes the cells before its next command, carries the
//! commands out, retries the head of each queue by its plan and posts the
//! events. The queues are cells of the one host thread a test runs on: the
//! stand-ins of a backend's lock-free single-producer single-consumer
//! queues.
//!
//! Each interface sends A-MPDUs ([`AmpduPhase`]) of up to
//! [`MODEL_AMPDU_SUBFRAMES`] subframes: under a key the new subframes are
//! numbered at their first transmission and a retransmitted one keeps its
//! number and gets the Retry bit; the air answers each aggregate with a
//! Block Ack (every subframe by default). `ModelAir::answer` queues one
//! `AirAnswer` per publication: ACK, BA bitmap, missing response, collision or
//! hardware timeout. The checked frame determines whether it expects no
//! response, an ACK or a Block Ack (including a single BAR). A mismatched
//! response poisons before publication and
//! quarantines the rejected operation until teardown. There is no separate
//! BA queue whose injection could escape to a later aggregate.
//! The builder rejects duplicate sequence numbers and subframes outside the
//! 64-sequence BA window rooted at
//! its first subframe, using sequence arithmetic modulo 4096. Refusal returns
//! both the unchanged builder and the rejected subframe before publication.
//!
//! Each concrete class pool uses the portable `MpduLayout` proof before
//! writing headers or copying an external body. Its allocation is privately
//! minted at the class capacity; `ClassFrame` proves the MPDU fits it.
//! Small and large classes share one pool implementation. Their private
//! `ModelClass` dispatch only erases or recovers the appropriate owner
//! variant, returning every other class unchanged on refusal.
//! `TxProtection` alone determines Protected and the MAC/CCMP prefix. Sent returns own that layout, body and the
//! identity of the original key installation. Retry supplies only a new
//! attempt's rates, never an independently reconstructed MPDU or body.
//! Key identity is an allocation identity in this host model; a reused slot
//! cannot match an earlier installation. A refused attempt returns all its
//! resources synchronously and allocates no PN or completion event.
//! Prepared operations retain a use of their key installation through their
//! terminal or cancellation. `KeyRemoved` waits for these owners; a returned
//! Sent retains only identity and therefore permits removal and slot reuse.
//! PTK and GTK material live in the model's installation table, separately from
//! cloneable identities. Removal clears its material after the last prepared
//! use ends. Uninstall and abandon deactivate the table, discard captured
//! ingress and clear all secrets even if a test retains an identity. Normal
//! disable/reenable preserves installed keys and their counters.
//! The unique `ModelAssociation` owns the protocol's decision. Modeled hardware
//! holds one CCMP record per interface; keys select it with their interface
//! identity, without sharing ownership of the association. The driver applies
//! its SPP mode before publishing material and records that order. A mode can
//! change only after the complete returned bank permits a new association.
//! `AirFrame::frame` contains actual CCMP ciphertext and MIC; `plaintext` is
//! the DMA image before encryption. `ModelAir::receive_ccmp` authenticates
//! encrypted input under the installed association before publishing verified
//! RX metadata. Full-bank association end is a pure ownership transition.
//! Pending GTK installation owns only a vacant slot, permission, KeyID and
//! material. The driver creates its identity and installed owner after the
//! hardware step, then publishes the success terminal at the RX boundary.
//! The key-table mutation and finite ingress capture do not wake the body.
//! Delivery wakes only after the old ingress is closed: reentrant capture
//! under the new key stays queued behind the terminal, while the frozen old
//! DMA/ISR/software facts are delivered before it.
//! A prepared retry submitted after removal is withdrawn in its AC's order,
//! without publication. Cancellation wakes the driver to finish the barrier.
//! An aggregate preflights every MPDU and the entire fresh-PN range before
//! changing any subframe. A publication refusal retains the complete operation;
//! submission after poisoning likewise transfers its owners to teardown custody.
//!
//! `ModelContext` selects an opaque context for each install lifetime, so
//! a station context can retain its `LinkEpoch` brand through every queue
//! and terminal. The model grants one epoch-source slot in its resources.
//!
//! Capacity is the tokens': every terminal returns a ticket, so no terminal
//! is ever lost; received frames beyond [`MODEL_RX_EVENTS`] queued are
//! dropped and the stream says [`EventsLost`] once.
//! Queued events keep FIFO order; after that finite queue, a pending loss
//! indication precedes the next synthetic continuous-RX frame.
//! The host fixture's VecDeque cannot express the token/capacity equation in
//! its type. A broken equation retains the offending owner, poisons the
//! backend and ends the installation without delivering later events. A
//! received owner dropped without recycle likewise poisons this fixture.
//!
//! [owner decisions on #563]: https://github.com/ermacv/open-esp-radio-rs/issues/563#issuecomment-6129037560

//! Publication and completion are separate owners. Tests may hold a result
//! while posting gate/key/disable barriers; only that publication can finish.
//! The model's 1 ms publication bound is synthetic model time. `set_time`
//! feeds the test's virtual clock. Hardware backends
//! must declare their own PPDU plus response/timeout bound.
//!
//! Unit tests and the `test-support` library use the same implementation,
//! including continuous RX and immediate recycling of its bounded slots. Only the unit-test module is under `cfg(test)`.
//! `tests/model_feature.rs` exercises these paths through the public port
//! from a separate test crate, so the model itself is compiled without that cfg.
