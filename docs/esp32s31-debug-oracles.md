# ESP32-S31 debug oracles

This index separates debug functions that reveal MMIO layout from functions
that only decode packets, DMA descriptors or software state.

The audited binary source is `_oracles/libpp.a`, SHA-256
`f863c65c3ed89cf5d2a2cbe0d6bca3b783ca35788a704bb68e13958e4b94958e`,
particularly the complete `hal_debug.o` member and its function-local format
strings. Addresses and fields are accepted into the SVD only when the loads,
shifts and masks agree with those strings.

## Direct MMIO decoders

| Function | Hardware area | SVD status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dbg_read_rx_misc` | RX filters, interface/BSSID policy, HE BSSID/color, HE options, nominal padding, RX power save and beamforming | decoded |
| `dbg_read_rx_count` | sparse RX success/error/hang counters | decoded and HIL observed |
| `dbg_read_color_collision` | 64-bit BSS-color bitmap and collision control | decoded and HIL observed |
| `dbg_read_ax_diag` | ten Trigger RX/OFDMA diagnostic words | decoded; no-Trigger HIL baseline |
| `dbg_read_axtb_diag`, `dbg_read_tb_diag` | four Trigger-based TX diagnostic words | decoded; no-Trigger HIL baseline |
| `dbg_read_bsr_info` | BSR control and eight hardware/software TID values | decoded and HIL observed |
| `dbg_read_muedca_timer` | four MU-EDCA timer words | decoded and HIL observed |
| `dbg_read_txq_conf1`, `dbg_read_txq_conf2` | reverse-addressed TB/EDCA queue configuration | decoded and HIL observed |
| `dbg_read_ack_rate`, `dbg_read_cts_rate` | ACK/CTS OFDM, CCK and SCCK response-rate tables | decoded |
| `dbg_read_bfr_rate` | BPSK/QPSK/16-QAM beamforming report profiles | decoded |
| `dbg_read_imrsp_power` | ten immediate-response format/rate/power profiles | decoded by the TX-power peripheral |
| `dbg_read_wdevdelay` | TX/RX CCK timing fields | decoded |
| `dbg_read_rx_ba` | hardware RX BlockAck entries | address geometry owned; field-name audit pending |
| `dbg_read_internal_txba` | hardware TX BlockAck state | address geometry owned; field-name audit pending |
| `dbg_read_key_entry` | MAC crypto key table and validity state | address geometry owned; field-name audit pending |
| `dbg_read_tx_mplen` | linked MPDU-length table | partial map; complete field-name audit pending |
| `dbg_read_tx_sig` | active TX queue PLCP/SIG vectors | major queue words mapped; residual diagnostic fields pending |
| `dbg_dump_txq_txinfo` | active queue information plus queue-local memory | mixed MMIO/memory; audit pending |

`dbg_read_nav_misc` is a two-byte `ret` and contains no register evidence.
`dbg_read_tx_power` is not a passive decoder: it calls PHY maximum-power
queries before logging the MAC table, so its fifty `0x20107428` RMW side
effects are recorded separately from the table reads.

## Packet and descriptor decoders

These functions are valuable for restoring wire and DMA formats, but must not
be cited as MMIO evidence unless an instruction independently loads a fixed
hardware address:

- `dbg_dump_trig_common_info`
- `dbg_dump_trig_user_ru`
- `dbg_dump_trig_user_ss`
- `dbg_dump_trig_basic_dependent`
- `dbg_dump_trig_bfrp_dependent`
- `dbg_dump_trig_mubar_dependent`
- `dbg_dump_trig_nfrp_user`
- `dbg_dump_trs_control`
- `dbg_dump_uph_control`
- `dbg_dump_musigb_mimo`
- `dbg_dump_musigb_non_mimo`
- `dbg_dump_rx_ba`
- `dbg_dump_rx_errors`
- `dbg_dump_rx_links`
- `dbg_dump_rx_ppdu`
- `dbg_dump_tx_end`
- `dbg_dump_tx_link`
- `dbg_read_tx_ppdu`

The `dbg_dump_trig_*` group is the primary oracle for Trigger Common Info,
per-user RU/SS fields and Basic/BFRP/MU-BAR/NFRP dependent information. It is
therefore the next source for the open Trigger/OFDMA parser even though it does
not expand the MMIO address map.

## Mutating debug helpers

The following symbols change hardware or debug policy and need the same
transaction-level treatment as ordinary HAL setters:

- `dbg_clr_hw_count`
- `dbg_complete_ignore_no_key`
- `dbg_disable_report_cbf`
- `dbg_tb_ignore_cca_enable`
- `dbg_check_mutimer`

Their symbol names alone are not sufficient to assign bit semantics. A field
is promoted only after the complete body and all reachable leaves are bounded.

## Other archives and ROM

`libnet80211.a` contains `dbg_hmac_*_statis_dump`, `esp_wifi_statis_dump`,
`bsscolor_event_dump` and TWT dump functions. They primarily expose software
state and protocol objects rather than raw MAC addresses, but they can connect
an already recovered register field to its higher-level 802.11 meaning.

The rev0 ROM ELF does not contain an equivalent rich `dbg_read_*` register
suite. Its debug-related public symbols are mainly configuration leaves such
as `phy_chan_dump_cfg`, `phy_csidump_force_lltf_cfg`,
`phy_txcal_debuge_mode_` and `phy_pbus_debugmode`. The register-map recovery
value is consequently concentrated in blob `hal_debug.o`; ROM remains the
stronger oracle for complete PHY algorithms and fixed-address leaf behavior.
