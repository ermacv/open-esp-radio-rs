//! A running lower-MAC phase: one object under `&mut`
//! ([`PortPhase`]), whose event stream and
//! operations a body's one loop drives ([owner decision on #563]).
//!
//! # Tokens
//!
//! Every token carries the install's brand `'id`, is minted once by the
//! install's resources and travels by value: an operation takes it, and
//! the event that ends the operation gives it back. So a portable core
//! holds the tokens of what it may do, and what it holds is what it may
//! do: a transmission it has no ticket for, a key it has no slot for or a
//! gate it has not closed does not compile.
//!
//! | Token | Taken by | Given back by |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | a transmit ticket ([`PhaseTypes::TicketKind`]) | [`InterfacePhase::submit`] | [`LowerMacTerminal::TxCompleted`] |
//! | a transmit buffer of a class ([`TxBufferClass`]), its memory ([`TxBufferMemory`]) | [`InterfacePhase::submit`], together with its [`ClassFrame`] | [`LowerMacTerminal::TxCompleted`], every buffer of the attempt |
//! | a key slot of a role's kind | [`InterfacePhase::install_pairwise_key`], [`InterfacePhase::install_group_key`] (the installed key holds it) | [`LowerMacTerminal::KeyRemoved`], after a removal |
//! | one GTK mutation permission per interface ([`KeyTypes::GroupPermission`]) | install/replace/select/remove GTK | the corresponding FIFO success terminal; uncertainty keeps it for teardown |
//! | one configure permission per interface ([`crate::ConfigurePermission`]) | `configure(permission, receive)` | [`LowerMacTerminal::Configured`], with the same permission and opaque context |
//! | one TSF permission per interface ([`crate::TsfPermission`]) | `sample_tsf(permission)` | [`LowerMacTerminal::TsfSampled`], with the same permission |
//! | a Block Ack slot | [`InterfacePhase::add_block_ack`] (the agreement holds it) | [`InterfacePhase::remove_block_ack`] |
//! | the open gate ([`GateOpen`]) | [`LowerMacPhase::close_gate`] | [`LowerMacPhase::open_gate`], which takes the closed gate ([`GateClosed`]) that [`LowerMacTerminal::GateClosed`] gave |
//! | a received frame's buffer | [`LowerMacEvent::Received`] | [`LowerMacPhase::recycle`] |
//!
//! A ticket and a buffer are different tokens ([owner decisions on #563]).
//! A ticket is a place in flight and a place for its terminal; their
//! number is bounded by the hardware. A buffer is memory of one class,
//! sized by the composition, from a pool the body holds: the caller
//! encodes its frame straight into it. A submission
//! takes one ticket and the buffers of its frames (an A-MPDU: one ticket
//! and a buffer per subframe), and its terminal gives all of them back. So
//! a submission never waits: an empty pool is the caller's own capacity,
//! and what the hardware cannot take at once (an occupied queue) the
//! backend keeps until it can. Queue permits are the backend's own and
//! never reach a caller. How many tickets and buffers each role holds,
//! with a reserve for its management frames, is the composition's
//! choice: the tokens are values it hands out.
//!
//! Settings without a terminal (EDCA, BSS color, TBTT plan, monitor and
//! Block Ack desired state) take effect before the next submission; the latest
//! value of a kind wins. Receive configuration and TSF sampling each consume
//! their interface's unique permission and occupy a FIFO command until their
//! terminal returns that same permission; neither can replace a prior request.
//!
//! An operation that waits for the air or for the attempts in flight (a
//! gate's closing, an interface's receive configuration, a key's removal)
//! returns at once, and its end arrives as an event of the stream. No
//! operation of the phase awaits.
//!
//! # Order
//!
//! The phase's operations reach the hardware in the order the caller made
//! them, through one queue to the driver: an attempt that names a key is
//! published after that key's install, and a key's removal ends after
//! every attempt that names it. A backend's conformance tests check both.
//!
//! The queue is strictly first in, first out: no command replaces another.
//! Its capacity is the tokens' ([owner decision]): one attempt per ticket,
//! two commands per pairwise slot, one command per interface's unique GTK
//! mutation permission, and two commands for the gate. Pairwise install and
//! removal, or gate closing and opening, may wait together; a GTK permission
//! returns only at its terminal. Thus the command capacity is
//! `tickets + 2 × pairwise slots + GTK permissions + configure permissions + TSF permissions + 2`.
//! There is one configure and one TSF permission per
//! interface, minted by `InterfaceCommandPool`. Block Ack is per-slot desired state;
//! repeated writes coalesce and never enter the command queue.
//!
//! [owner decision]: https://github.com/ermacv/open-esp-radio-rs/issues/563#issuecomment-6130970169
//!
//! # Protected frames
//!
//! Preparation derives the Protected bit from [`TxProtection`] and
//! leaves the 8 octets of its CCMP header after its MAC header; its length
//! counts them, not the MIC. At the first transmission of the MPDU the
//! backend writes the CCMP header with a new packet number of the key into
//! the buffer, and the hardware appends the MIC; the plan's transmissions
//! keep it. The completion gives the buffer back as `Sent`
//! ([`TxBufferPool::Sent`]): a retransmission of the same MPDU
//! ([`TxSource::Retransmission`]) keeps its packet number, and only a
//! renewed buffer ([`TxBufferPool::renew`]) is numbered anew. A received
//! frame whose crypto status is
//! [`RxCryptoStatus::DecryptedAndIntegrityVerified`](crate::RxCryptoStatus)
//! keeps its CCMP header, for the receiver's replay check, and loses its
//! MIC ([owner decision on #563](https://github.com/ermacv/open-esp-radio-rs/issues/563#issuecomment-6131631789)).
//!
//! # Compile-fail tests
//!
//! No caller mints a token: a gate, a ticket or a buffer comes only from
//! the install's resources.
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0432
//! use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::GatePlace;
//! ```
//!
//! Nor copies one:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0382
//! # use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::GateOpen;
//! fn twice<'id>(gate: GateOpen<'id>) -> (GateOpen<'id>, GateOpen<'id>) {
//!     (gate, gate)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0599
//! # use oer_radio_port::Slot;
//! fn copy<'id, K>(ticket: &Slot<'id, K>) -> Slot<'id, K> {
//!     ticket.clone()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Its compiling twin moves the token on, as an operation takes it:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::{GateClosed, GateOpen, LowerMacPhase, PhaseTypes};
//! fn close<'p, 'id: 'p, P: LowerMacPhase<'p, 'id>>(phase: &mut P, gate: GateOpen<'id, <P::Types as PhaseTypes<'id>>::GatePath>) {
//!     phase.close_gate(gate);
//! }
//! fn open<'p, 'id: 'p, P: LowerMacPhase<'p, 'id>>(phase: &mut P, gate: GateClosed<'id, <P::Types as PhaseTypes<'id>>::GatePath>) -> GateOpen<'id, <P::Types as PhaseTypes<'id>>::GatePath> {
//!     phase.open_gate(gate)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The open gate does not open a gate, nor the closed one close it:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0308
//! # use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::{GateOpen, LowerMacPhase, PhaseTypes};
//! fn reopen<'p, 'id: 'p, P: LowerMacPhase<'p, 'id>>(phase: &mut P, gate: GateOpen<'id, <P::Types as PhaseTypes<'id>>::GatePath>) {
//!     let _ = phase.open_gate(gate);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A frame a buffer's class does not fit has no [`ClassFrame`], whose
//! fields no caller sets:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0451
//! # use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::{ClassFrame, TxFrame};
//! fn forge<'p, 'id, C, K>(frame: TxFrame<'p, 'id, K>) -> ClassFrame<'p, 'id, C, K> {
//!     ClassFrame { frame, class: core::marker::PhantomData }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Its compiling twin checks the frame against the class:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::{ClassFrame, Ieee80211Capabilities, TxBufferClass, TxFrame};
//! fn fit<'p, 'id, C: TxBufferClass, K: Ieee80211Capabilities>(
//!     frame: TxFrame<'p, 'id, K>,
//! ) -> Result<ClassFrame<'p, 'id, C, K>, TxFrame<'p, 'id, K>> {
//!     ClassFrame::new(frame)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! An attempt moves its context, ticket and buffer once:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0382
//! # use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::*;
//! fn twice<'p, 'id: 'p, I>(interface: &mut I, attempt: InterfaceAttempt<'_, 'p, 'id, I>)
//! where I: InterfacePhase<'p, 'id> {
//!     let _ = interface.submit(attempt.admit());
//!     let _ = interface.submit(attempt.admit());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Its compiling twin moves each operation once, with no `Clone` bound:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::*;
//! fn one<'p, 'id: 'p, I>(interface: &mut I, attempt: InterfaceAttempt<'_, 'p, 'id, I>)
//! where I: InterfacePhase<'p, 'id> {
//!     let _ = interface.submit(attempt.admit());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A frame checked on one phase cannot be submitted on an unrelated one:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::*;
//! fn another_phase<'p, 'q, 'id: 'p + 'q, I, J>(
//!     interface: &mut J, attempt: InterfaceAttempt<'_, 'p, 'id, I>,
//! ) where
//!     I: InterfacePhase<'p, 'id>,
//!     J: InterfacePhase<'q, 'id, Caps = I::Caps, Types = I::Types, Role = I::Role>,
//! {
//!     let _ = interface.submit(attempt.admit());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Event stream end
//!
//! A command's [`Poisoned`] result closes admission; earlier terminals may
//! still be waiting. `next_event` ends with [`oer_radio_port::EventEnd`]:
//! `Drained` promises every admitted terminal was returned, while `Quarantined`
//! retains undelivered owners in the common lifecycle's permanent quarantine.
//! The body checks its outstanding identities before accepting `Drained`.
//! On `Quarantined` it fail-stops immediately, without disable or another
//! drain. Subsequent event calls, including through a new phase loan, return
//! the same end and cause. Dropping a quarantine receipt releases no owners.
