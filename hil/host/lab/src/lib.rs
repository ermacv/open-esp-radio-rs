//! HIL stand operation at the level of a run: the laboratory configuration
//! a run reads from the stand file, the lock a run holds on its boards and
//! fixtures, the pre-run observation of the cell, fixture software leases,
//! the recovery of a board that stopped answering and the post-mortem of a
//! failed repetition. The stand implements the link's `Dut` and
//! `StationNetwork` ports for the board it leased.
//!
//! It actuates no hardware and writes no flash record itself: boards are
//! reached through board I/O (`oer-hil-board`), exclusion and the board
//! journal belong to the arbiter, flashing to the flash operation.
