#![no_std]
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Hardware-independent IEEE 802.11 protocol building blocks.
//!
//! This crate owns bounded frame parsing and protocol state only. It has no
//! MMIO, DMA, interrupt, executor, allocator, ESP32-S31, vendor archive, or
//! ROM ABI dependency.
//!
//! [`address::Bssid`] proves a nonzero individual address. Scan storage keeps
//! vacant cells as `None`; [`scan::ScanRecord::new`] requires the actual BSSID,
//! channel and RSSI, and [`scan::ScanTable::records`] iterates present records.
//!
//! Management and A-MSDU construction retain immutable frame parts through
//! capacity admission and writing. Those same parts determine the output
//! length; no independent final-offset assertion protects the layout.
//! In-place station encapsulation borrows prefix and payload separately so
//! writing a new prefix cannot overwrite the retained Ethernet payload.
//!
//! The parser contract of [the strict-lint milestone](https://github.com/ermacv/open-esp-radio-rs/issues/751)
//! requires field boundaries established with `split_first_chunk` and
//! retained as fixed-size arrays through subsequent processing. This is
//! required before step 2 of #563 merges; replacing indexing mechanically
//! with `.get()` or suppressing its lint does not establish the contract.
