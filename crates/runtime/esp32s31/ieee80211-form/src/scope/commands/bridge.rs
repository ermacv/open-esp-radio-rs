//! Direct command-publication prototype, without a hardware PortBackend.
//!
//! Whole branded owners stay in `Held`. Only execution records and affine
//! place names enter permanent storage. The model executor never dereferences
//! a DMA address or programs MMIO: its completion means the model's finite
//! operation finished. A real DMA terminal requires the driver's completion
//! proof, not merely acceptance by a hardware queue.
//!
//! Cancellation of a reply wait leaves every owner in Held. When the driver's
//! stop proved DMA quiescent (on any of the form's own stop paths; the core's
//! fail-stop and whole-run cancel still quarantine, #763), `Held::finish`
//! takes Held (ending every producer endpoint), this binding's executor
//! (lent by `StoppedOwners::parts` from the stopped `Bridged` hardware) and
//! that `DriverStopped` proof: it withdraws every pending record with its key
//! erased, takes every replied record back and returns every remaining owner.
//! Without the proof Held stays quarantined: dropping it leaks every owner,
//! never dropping one. After every stop whose drain completed, the form
//! itself withdraws the pending records of the executor inside `Bridged` and
//! zeroes their keys before any owner can go into quarantine. A key command
//! published after that stop keeps its record copy until reset.
//! Forgetting Held cannot free the permanent records; names have no pointer
//! back to it. Composition wakers may schedule, never synchronously detach.
//!
//! Key commands and execution records use the same zeroizing `Ccmp128Key`.
//! Projection borrows material to initialize the record owner and erases the
//! Held owner before publication. Apply borrows the permanent owner; apply
//! and withdrawal both erase it in place before publishing their typed reply.
