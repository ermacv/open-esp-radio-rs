# Sparse reviewed knowledge

`open-radio-vendor-review` owns the generic, human-sized facts that survive
regeneration of Blobray observations and vendor artifact updates.

The crate deliberately does not know about specific chips, register names, ABI
catalogs, SVD, ELF, qualification policy or output paths. Consumers interpret
the consumer-owned `kind` and `value`, while the generic layer owns canonical
typed semantic subjects and blob-local occurrence identities. It validates:

- stable pack, assertion, vendor-bug and entity-binding identifiers;
- evidence, provenance and applicability;
- artifact SHA-256 guards;
- fail-closed conflicts between assertions with the same subject and kind;
- one semantic target per occurrence in overlapping applicability, while one
  semantic entity may intentionally collect multiple occurrences;
- exact artifact applicability and occurrence-linked evidence for bindings;
- deterministic merge and semantic fingerprints.

An empty pack is a valid generated review destination. It contributes no facts
until a reviewer adds a record.

Generated observations are not accepted facts and do not belong in these
packs. A project should add a record only after a reviewer accepts a name,
hardware semantic, ABI meaning or vendor defect.

Register-model consumers accept one `register-identity` assertion whose
canonical `register:chip/address-space/address/width` subject owns the physical
coordinates and whose scalar string value is
`REGION.NAME`. That one reviewed fact identifies existing geometry or
authorizes materializing absent geometry. The domain-agnostic review-model
keeps the semantic domain typed; the register consumer validates the scalar and
rejects the retired `register-declaration` and `register-name` kinds. Merely
observing software reads or writes never constitutes an identity fact and
never proves hardware access or W1C semantics.
