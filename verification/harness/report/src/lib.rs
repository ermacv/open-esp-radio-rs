//! Reviewer reports of the typed vendor-comparison scenarios.
//!
//! Nothing here decides a verdict or a recorded set: the engine hands each
//! claimed suite's [`Findings`] to [`Reviewer`], which writes the untriaged
//! locations, the function view and the closure gateways beside the run and
//! prints the compared pairs no claim names. [`inspect`] reads pinned vendor
//! code without running a scenario. The dependency runs from this crate to
//! the engine only, so an edit here leaves the evidence shards current.
