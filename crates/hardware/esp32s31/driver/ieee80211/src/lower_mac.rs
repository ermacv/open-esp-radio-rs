//! The hardware side of the ESP32-S31 lower-MAC backend.
//!
//! [`LowerMacCore`] is the state the backend's driver owns by value: the interfaces, the installed keys, the receive Block Ack
//! banks, and the one published attempt of each EDCA queue. It drives the
//! ESP32-S31 register seams through a caller-supplied [`LowerMacHardware`]
//! and never waits: the runtime owns the event queues, the interrupt
//! entries, the publication deadlines, the software queue of each access
//! category ahead of the core and the asynchronous PHY retune an `Enable`
//! needs, and serves the phase contract
//! (`oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::phase`) over this core.
//!
//! # Checked operations
//!
//! Submission consumes a branded free queue and an admission ticket. Key
//! installation returns an affine `KeyHandle`; `admit_key` borrows that live
//! handle and consumes a ticket to issue one `KeyUse`. Station GTK installation
//! returns `ReceiveKeyHandle`, which has only a consuming removal path and
//! cannot enter TX admission or numbering. The installed material
//! cannot be removed while any attempt holds a right. `MpduValues::checked`
//! validates the caller's untrusted request before its fields become private.
//! Hardware failures retain the submitted owners, including quarantine.
//!
//! `CorePools<N>` issues the construction authority and exactly `N` TX
//! tickets. `KeyUseCount<N>` has a width checked against that same pool in
//! const evaluation; only consuming a ticket/right can increment/decrement it.
//! The backend uses its phase ticket count for that same `N`. A
//! protected MPDU or A-MPDU plan owns its right, whose selector identifies the
//! still-programmed CCMP material; publication never searches by a copied
//! key index. Removal consumes the handle and completes at its FIFO position
//! when there are no rights, or immediately after the last TX terminal.
//! Poisoned retains rights and DMA owners and never reports `KeyRemoved`.
//!
//! # Lifecycle and command barriers
//!
//! Construction returns [`DisabledCore`]. Enable consumes it, either returning
//! [`EnabledCore`] or retaining the whole bank in [`RetuningCore`]. Disable
//! consumes the enabled owner; [`DisablingCore::finish`] returns the disabled
//! owner and emits its one terminal only after all publications ended. A
//! poisoned bank retains its owners. Channel changes and dismantling exist
//! only on the disabled type. The gate type survives disable and retune.
//!
//! Closing first transfers the enabled bank to [`ClosingGate`], whose new
//! attempts stay held. Only a drained published prefix constructs [`ClosedGate`]
//! and blocks hardware queues. Opening consumes this evidence; publication
//! failure returns every held owner and retains the published prefix.
//!
//! Receive configuration consumes either the disabled or enabled bank into
//! [`Configuring`]. That owner withdraws its role's held frames and waits for
//! that role's published frames, then returns the original lifecycle owner.
//! No later FIFO command can publish through a configuration barrier. The
//! other interface's outstanding frames keep their own completion path.
//!
//! # Transmit buffers
//!
//! A transmit buffer is a whole ordinary TX slot ([`TxSlot`]): the pinned
//! descriptor and source buffer the hardware reads, whose MPDU follows the
//! TX metadata word. The caller holds the slot, encodes the MPDU into it
//! and submits it with the attempt; it comes back with the attempt's
//! completion ([`LowerMacSink::tx_completed`]). The backend numbers a fresh
//! protected MPDU at its first transmission ([`LowerMacCore::number`]): the
//! key's software packet-number allocator writes its CCMP header. Only
//! `Ok(())` confirms that write; a [`CcmpNumberingError`] prevents TX
//! preparation. Receive-only key handles are rejected at compile time.
//!
//! # One publication per attempt, one attempt per EDCA queue
//!
//! An attempt is published through
//! [`OrdinaryTxOwner::start_queued_single_attempt`]: exactly one descriptor
//! publication at the submitted rate with the caller's protection, backoff
//! and power ceiling. Its completion, a collision detach or the hardware
//! timeout abort ends it; the driver carries known-result retries out by
//! submitting the same MPDU again (`MpduValues::retry`).
//! Retry marking uses the checked management/data `FrameControl` and the
//! encoded MPDU's length. An incomplete or unsupported field returns
//! `InvalidRetryHeader` with the original slot before publication; neither
//! slot capacity nor a failed buffer borrow can silently skip the marking.
//!
//! The chip's pure completion decoder returns `Observed(status)` or
//! `NoEffect`, or a `CompletionFault`. Only Observed constructs completed
//! metadata and consumes the published attempt through `finish(status)`.
//! NoEffect retains the same descriptor, deadline and attempt until its real
//! result or hardware timeout. SecurityKeyError and InvalidStatus propagate
//! through `LowerMacFault::Tx` to the existing poisoned-install path; they
//! return no TX terminal or slot. TimedOut ends the attempt with an unknown
//! result, and the backend never republishes it.
//!
//! The S31 MAC has four ordinary EDCA queues (voice, video, best effort,
//! background), each with its own descriptor, completion bank and latched
//! completion, timeout and collision state
//! (`pac/src/wifi/mac/tx/queue.rs`); the vendor publishes them concurrently
//! (`ppTxPkt` maps user priorities onto them) and handles their collisions
//! and timeouts per queue (`lmacProcessCollisions`,
//! `lmacProcessAllTxTimeout`). The core holds one attempt per queue
//! within the core; the driver's software queue holds the
//! next ones.
//!
//! The MAC interrupt's task events do not name a queue, so one
//! [`LowerMacCore::service`] call offers the same edge to every published
//! queue, and each claims only its own queue's state; an edge no queue
//! claims is ignored, and a lost one still ends in the publication
//! deadline's quarantine. A timeout abort forces the MAC-wide CCA for its
//! 16 µs settle, so aborts run one at a time: a queue whose timeout arrives
//! while another settles keeps its latched timeout and is aborted right
//! after that settle ends.
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! The S31 draws its backoff in software, so only `Backoff::Slots` is
//! accepted. Coexistence maps `CoexPriority::Normal` onto the static
//! per-access-category priority of
//! [`LegacyTxQueue::vendor_data_packet_priority`] and
//! `CoexPriority::Elevated` onto the radio system's connection-frame
//! priorities. An individually addressed frame without acknowledgement is
//! published at legacy rates only, the one program with a response field;
//! hardware has not confirmed its on-air behaviour. A published attempt
//! cannot be withdrawn: the S31 abort path needs the queue's hardware
//! timeout edge. A-MPDU transmission returns in step 2 (#563); access-point
//! TBTT schedules are not implemented, as the qualification catalog
//! records.
