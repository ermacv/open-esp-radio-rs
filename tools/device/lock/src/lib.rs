//! The device lock: one process owns a board at a time.
//!
//! The key is the board's [`DeviceId`] (its MAC, an Espressif USB
//! Serial/JTAG port's serial number), the file
//! `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/open-esp-radio/devices/<MAC>.lock` (the XDG cache
//! directory when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset), locked with the foundation's
//! `flock` ([`oer_process::lock::FileLock`]). The holder writes its
//! [`Holder`] record into the file, so a refused process names who holds
//! the board. A lock is held for a whole operation: a flash with its reopen
//! and start, a reset, a whole monitor, or a HIL lease with its power cycles.
//! The broker explicitly unlocks it after admitted I/O closes, independently
//! of unrelated descriptor copies inherited by a concurrent fork.
//!
//! An independent lifetime broker owns the lock's file description. Owned
//! guards keep its admission channel alive; delegates carry an explicit
//! [`oer_process::Context`] capability for that board. [`DeviceAccess::operation`]
//! atomically admits I/O and retains exclusion until its returned guard drops.
//! After owner loss the broker rejects new operations, stops remaining lifetime
//! holders after bounded cleanup and waits for connection closure and complete
//! exit of commands and processes claimed by cleanup.
//! Ports and their reader threads must close before their operation guard.
//!
//! Every acquisition in one process shares its owning guard through a registry.
//! Delegates never receive the flock descriptor and cannot unlock another I/O.
