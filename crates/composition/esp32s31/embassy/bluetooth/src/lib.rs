//! ESP32-S31 Bluetooth LE radio composition over Embassy-compatible time.
//!
//! The Bluetooth Controller is a client of the shared radio
//! (`oer-esp32s31-radio-runtime`). [`BluetoothParked::new`] claims the static
//! controller memory once per boot: the BLE PHY environment, the
//! direction-finding workspace, one pool per role and both global receive
//! chains, all placed in internal SRAM. It also consumes the unique
//! `&'static mut BluetoothSystemRuntime` supplied by the staged `runtime_main`
//! in `hil/targets/esp32s31/agent/src/main.rs`. `Runtime::pin_static` returns
//! the shared runtime and its affine queue claim without an acquisition flag
//! or retry path. [`start`] then runs one Controller
//! epoch from the parked partition to an installed radio runtime:
//!
//! 1. enters common radio power and enables the Bluetooth module clocks,
//!    Controller resets and low-power timer clock;
//! 2. runs Controller HAL, scheduler and modem low-power initialization;
//! 3. prepares the shared PHY through the radio system, joins it and the
//!    shared BTBB baseband, tracking the PHY when the join makes it due;
//! 4. enables the BLE base stack and publishes the public address;
//! 5. prepares Controller output, starts the runtime timer, publishes both
//!    interrupt owners and binds the three CPU routes to one dispatcher;
//! 6. installs the radio role in the runtime.
//!
//! It returns the running client and an `Installed<BluetoothSystemBackend>`
//! pairing the backend with its independently owned driver. The HCI service
//! returns `PortEnd` with its `Served` output and the uninstalled owners.
//!
//! The dispatcher services source 124, 127 and 133 and forwards the scheduler
//! and source-127 worker wakes. The radio's driver runs inside its port,
//! joined with the HCI service; [`BluetoothSystem::run`] drives the
//! source-127 timer task until it faults or an interrupt service fails, and
//! publishes the Controller's active roles as Bluetooth LE status bits in the
//! radio system's coexistence schedule. Each epoch enables coexistence for
//! Bluetooth when it starts and disables it when it stops, after withdrawing
//! every status bit.
//! [`BluetoothSystem::stop`] takes what the port's uninstall returned
//! ([`BluetoothSystemUninstalled`]: the radio and hardware), reverses the
//! epoch and returns [`BluetoothStopped`]. Ordinary teardown returns a parked
//! partition with reset controller memory and its affine outcome-queue claim.
//! After `TerminalRejected`, the same teardown releases clocks and PHY, but
//! returns stopped hardware separately from quarantined outcomes; it cannot
//! feed the old queue to [`start`] again. Periodic PHY tracking belongs to the radio
//! system (`RadioSystem::run_tracking`).
//!
//! [`start_bluetooth_hci`] creates the HCI Controller once per boot: the
//! in-process transport, whose Host end goes to the Host stack, and the
//! service that runs the portable Controller core as the body of each
//! Controller epoch's port. Between Controller epochs the service retires the
//! drained Host end and restarts it with a fresh core.
//! [`BluetoothEntropy`] binds the SoC entropy service as its random source.
//!
//! The shared-core cost probe remains 6844 bytes of RV32 text and 432 bytes
//! per probe future (Rust 1.97.1, opt-level 3, LTO, one codegen unit). It uses
//! synthetic backends and does not measure the concrete Bluetooth retirement
//! or queue-claim path. This block adds `RuntimeQueue`, the three named
//! uninstall outcomes and `BluetoothStopped`; Wi-Fi's API does not change.
//!
//! Power and clock failures roll back to the parked client; any failure
//! after the first Controller write keeps its owners fail-stop.
