#![no_std]
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Hardware-independent Bluetooth Low Energy Link Layer building blocks.
//!
//! This crate owns bounded over-the-air PDU codecs and the protocol state of
//! one connection: advertising and scan-response PDUs, advertising report
//! parsing and duplicate filtering, connection indication, channel selection
//! and instants, control procedures, encryption and the Direct Test Mode
//! session planner. It has no HCI, MMIO, DMA, interrupt, executor, allocator,
//! ESP32-S31, vendor-archive or ROM-ABI dependency. The Controller core
//! schedules roles and composes these pieces.
//!
//! [`connection::maintenance`] admits provisional budgeted event omissions on
//! the same connection owner, retaining initial acknowledgement, Instant and
//! post-maintenance recovery obligations. This protocol decision grants no
//! hardware access or timing budget; both remain with the lower radio owner.
