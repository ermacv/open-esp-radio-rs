//! Capacity as values: the slot pools and permit pools of one install.
//!
//! A port's capacity is never a refusal ([ownership and refusals]). What
//! the hardware holds at once (key slots, Block Ack slots, accept-list
//! entries, a transmit queue, the one operation of a radio) is a set of
//! tokens the install mints once, through the [`Mint`] that [`branded`]
//! makes for each block's `run_port` to hand its backend, branded by the install
//! (`'id`) and by the pool's kind marker `Kind`, which keeps pools apart
//! (a Wi-Fi station's key slots and an access point's; a Bluetooth LE
//! advertising set and a connection).
//!
//! - A **slot** ([`Slot`]) is taken synchronously: a pool is an array of
//!   slots its holder owns, so how many are left is in the types, and an
//!   empty pool is an array of none, not a run-time `None`. Installing a
//!   resource moves a slot into it, and removing the resource gives the
//!   slot back.
//! - A **permit** ([`Permit`]) is awaited: a [`PermitPool`] holds a fixed
//!   number, and taking one waits while all are held, never refused. A
//!   submission moves its permit into the backend, which keeps the pool in
//!   its held part of the install (`PortBackend::Held`) and takes the
//!   permit back when the work ends, before it hands the terminal event
//!   out: released when the air finished, not when a handle drops, and
//!   never lost with an event dropped unread; a cancel is only a request. In which order waiting
//!   takers are served is the pool's documented policy (first in, first out
//!   by default), which the conformance suite checks.
//! - A **seat** ([`Seat`]) is a place in a permit pool's line: a taker
//!   lends its seat to [`PermitPool::take`] for as long as it waits, so a
//!   taker without one cannot exist, and a pool whose line has a place per
//!   seat never overflows. [`Permits`] issues a kind's seats with the
//!   [`Line`] that sizes its pools, so the line's capacity is a value, as
//!   every other capacity is. A line is a copyable receipt: several pools
//!   whose takers are the same seats (a transmit queue's pool each) take
//!   it, each with a place for every seat, and since a seat waits in one
//!   take at a time, none of them overflows. The seat stays with its taker: a take that
//!   is served or dropped ends the loan, and the taker waits again with
//!   the same seat (an A-MPDU builder's sequential buffer takes). What a
//!   seat stands for beyond its kind (an interface's role and access
//!   category) is its value: the backend that minted it maps its
//!   [`index`](Seat::index), so the pool and its take are generic over the
//!   kind alone.
//!
//! A caller counts its own slots: it plans against the same constant the
//! backend minted its pool with, so taking a slot synchronously is an
//! invariant of that count (popping the array it holds), never a refusal.
//!
//! The clients of one install share a pool only inside the body's task. A
//! token is branded, so it never enters `'static` storage such as an
//! interrupt handler's: a backend keeps the tokens on the task side, keyed
//! by their [`index`](Permit::index), and its interrupt carries only the
//! index.
//!
//! This package owns no state and never waits: it states the tokens and the
//! rules. A pool's free list, its waiters and their wake-ups belong to a
//! runtime crate or to the backend that keeps it. The backend never refuses
//! for capacity: a caller takes synchronously from the slots it holds, and
//! one that holds none turns that into its protocol's decision (an access
//! point refuses an association).
//!
//! A backend declares one pool for each kind in its `Pools` layout. Consuming
//! [`Mint::into_pools`] issues the whole set once; the factory cannot repeat
//! issuance with the same mint. The kind keeps the declared pools apart.
//!
//! No token is `Clone`, `Copy` or `Default`, and only a [`Mint`] makes
//! one, so no caller adds capacity:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0599
//! # use oer_radio_port::Slot;
//! fn copy<'id, K>(slot: &Slot<'id, K>) -> Slot<'id, K> {
//!     slot.clone()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0451
//! # use core::marker::PhantomData;
//! # use oer_radio_port::Slot;
//! fn forge<'id, Kind>() -> Slot<'id, Kind> {
//!     Slot { index: 0, brand: PhantomData, kind: PhantomData }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0382
//! # use oer_radio_port::Slot;
//! fn install_twice<'id, Kind>(slot: Slot<'id, Kind>, install: impl Fn(Slot<'id, Kind>)) {
//!     install(slot);
//!     install(slot);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A seat, too, is neither cloned nor forged, and no caller makes a line:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0599
//! # use oer_radio_port::Seat;
//! fn copy<'id, K>(seat: &Seat<'id, K>) -> Seat<'id, K> {
//!     seat.clone()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0451
//! # use core::marker::PhantomData;
//! # use oer_radio_port::Seat;
//! fn forge<'id, K>() -> Seat<'id, K> {
//!     Seat { index: 0, brand: PhantomData, kind: PhantomData }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0451
//! # use core::marker::PhantomData;
//! # use oer_radio_port::Line;
//! fn forge<'id, K>() -> Line<'id, K, 4> {
//!     Line { brand: PhantomData, kind: PhantomData }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A take needs a seat, of the pool's own kind:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0061
//! # use oer_radio_port::PermitPool;
//! async fn unseated<'id, K>(pool: &impl PermitPool<'id, K>) {
//!     let _ = pool.take().await;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0308
//! # use oer_radio_port::{PermitPool, Seat};
//! async fn elsewhere<'id, K, J>(pool: &impl PermitPool<'id, K>, seat: &mut Seat<'id, J>) {
//!     let _ = pool.take(seat).await;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Their compiling twin takes with a seat of the pool's kind and keeps it
//! for the next take:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_radio_port::{Permit, PermitPool, Seat};
//! async fn twice<'id, K>(
//!     pool: &impl PermitPool<'id, K>,
//!     mut seat: Seat<'id, K>,
//! ) -> (Permit<'id, K>, Permit<'id, K>, Seat<'id, K>) {
//!     let first = pool.take(&mut seat).await;
//!     let second = pool.take(&mut seat).await;
//!     (first, second, seat)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A slot of one install does not reach another, nor leaves its body for
//! `'static`; neither has an error code of its own (a lifetime error):
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use oer_radio_port::Slot;
//! fn mix<'a, 'b, Kind>(slot: Slot<'a, Kind>) -> Slot<'b, Kind> {
//!     slot
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use oer_radio_port::Slot;
//! fn keep<'id, Kind>(slot: Slot<'id, Kind>) -> Slot<'static, Kind> {
//!     slot
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The brand is invariant: even a brand that outlives another does not
//! shrink to it, so a slot of an outer install never passes for an inner
//! one's:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use oer_radio_port::Slot;
//! fn shrink<'a: 'b, 'b, K>(slot: Slot<'a, K>) -> Slot<'b, K> {
//!     slot
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The compiling twins of the slot rules move a slot within its own install:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_radio_port::Slot;
//! fn install_once<'id, Kind>(slot: Slot<'id, Kind>, install: impl Fn(Slot<'id, Kind>)) {
//!     install(slot);
//! }
//! fn same<'a, Kind>(slot: Slot<'a, Kind>) -> Slot<'a, Kind> {
//!     slot
//! }
//! fn index<Kind>(slot: &Slot<'_, Kind>) -> u8 {
//!     slot.index()
//! }
//! ```
