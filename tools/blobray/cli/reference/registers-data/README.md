## Captured data, tables and coefficients

`blobray_application::data::export(request, executables, memory, control)`
reads exact ranges from one captured object in process. It does not run an
analyzer or infer a table boundary.

A `DataRequest` has the `object` (`ObjectId`: the containing executable's
content and the standalone or archive-member location), an optional anchor
`symbol` and 1–32 `ranges`. Copy the object identity from an inventory; it
retains the archive member ordinal even when names and bytes repeat. The
executable the object names must be among `executables`. Each range uses one
of these selectors:

| Selector | JSON fields in addition to `kind` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `section` | `section`, `offset`, `length` | Explicit section-relative bytes |
| `symbol` | `symbol`, `length` (integer or null) | Exact static or dynamic SymbolId of this object; null uses its declared size |
| `image` | `address`, `length` | Virtual address in a file-backed load mapping of an executable ELF |

The prepared-object profile requires little-endian RV32 ET_REL/ET_EXEC with at most one each
of SHT_SYMTAB and SHT_DYNSYM; table-free section/range selection is supported; names
such as `.symtab` are not table identity. Dynamic symbol selection does not enable
dynamic loading, TLS or relocation application. Section relocations must reference
the static table through `sh_link`; a different table is an explicit unsupported
profile, never an index interpreted in the static table. A zero-sized symbol needs
an explicit length. A sized symbol cannot be expanded past its declared size.
Overflow, out-of-range, ambiguous or unmapped addresses, compressed sections and
NOBITS are explicit errors. Requests never guess length from the next symbol.
Several ranges share one prepared ELF owner and section metadata; borrowed views
cannot escape its callback.

The `DataExport` returns the object's content identity, the selected bytes
concatenated in range order, and one span per range: selector, section and
section range, file range, image address when known, writability, the SHA-256
of its bytes and its offset into the concatenated bytes.

Writable sections are marked as initialization data, never current runtime
state. Each span reports the section's relocation count,
`overlapping_relocations` for the selected byte range and
`unknown_relocation_extents` for the section. Known fixed-width writes ending at the range start
or starting at its end do not overlap. Unknown transformations cannot establish
nonoverlap from their offset alone. The pinned structural parser currently
supplies RV32 NONE/32/64 classifications; other types retain unknown extents.
Known writes beyond the section are rejected. ET_EXEC relocation sites are
normalized from virtual to section-relative coordinates. No relocation is
applied by the export.

An export has no accepted assertion. It does not generate Rust, publish
register definitions or claim qualification.

## Library register accesses

`register-accesses` analyzes every function of the given libraries in its own
process and reports the memory addresses they access. Inputs are read once and
identified by content, and nothing is retained.

```console
blobray --format json register-accesses --input libphy=/path/to/libphy.a --range 0x20000000:0x9c00
```

Each `--input ROLE=PATH` is an archive or ELF; a function names its input by
position. Every STT_FUNC symbol of a nonempty executable section of every
object is analyzed. Each `--range START:LENGTH` selects resolved addresses that
overlap it; without a range every numeric address is reported, and unresolved
addresses are reported either way. `--working-memory-mib`, `--timeout-secs`
and `--max-work-units` bound the analysis cooperatively.

`--address ADDR` (repeatable) keeps the observations in that 32-bit word and
`--function NAME` (repeatable) those of that function; blocked functions it
names, every gap and the summary are never filtered, so a selection cannot
hide an incomplete analysis. `--group-by address|function` groups the selected
observations: one group per word (unresolved addresses first) listing each
function by access kind (a masked expression is `expression`), width and mask
with a count, or one group per
function listing each word the same way. A group's function carries its
symbol identity, so same-named functions of different archive members or
unnamed functions stay apart; the human format shows the member ordinal. The human format prints the groups
before the summary line and groups by address when a filter is given without
`--group-by`.

A store observation also carries `stored`: the runs of the stored value,
low bits first, each from a fixed value, bits of a register at the function's
entry (an argument for `a0`..`a7`), bits of a loaded value (with `same_word`
for the stored word itself, the bits a read-modify-write keeps) or unknown.
Each bit follows the analysis' expressions through bitwise logic, constant
shifts and additions that cannot carry; anything else is unknown, never
guessed. Each expression node is evaluated once per function, memoized
in working memory reserved before it grows and charged one unit of the work
budget, so shared subexpressions cost no repeated walk and
`--working-memory-mib`, `--max-work-units` and the deadline bound the
evaluation. The human groups print them high bits first, for example
`[31:25]=kept [24:18]=arg0[6:0] [17:0]=kept`, and another word's bits with
their load width (`load 1B 0xa[7:0]`); entries with different sources stay
apart, keyed by the sources themselves.

The JSON document streams `{"schema":5,"inputs":[...],"abi":...,"records":[...],"groups":[...],"summary":{...}}`;
`records` holds the selected records and `groups` appears only with
`--group-by`.
`inputs` lists each input's role and SHA-256. A record is an `observation` (the
function, the record ordinal and exact original fact, the address or null, its
alternative index and a read-selection or write-replacement mask), a `blocked`
function whose analysis stopped (for example an unknown extent), or a `gap`
naming code no function was selected from: an unsupported object, a thin
archive member, a malformed container or an ELF diagnostic. The summary counts
analyzed, partial and blocked functions, gaps and observations, and breaks the
partial functions down by cause (`partial_causes`, see
[interfaces and formats](../interfaces-formats/README.md)). `cargo registers
inventory` compares these accesses with the register model.

Observations name no hardware registers: the reviewed register model owns
register identity and fields. Instruction access widths remain observations,
not physical register widths. Masks describe analyzed expressions, not proven
physical fields or safe hardware RMW. Finite alternatives are may-addresses;
unresolved values are never discarded. The summary does not promise complete
hardware coverage or absence of register accesses.

The independent [register tool](../../../../registers/README.md) owns
source-model initialization, SVD import, reviewed source applicability and
four-output publication. A Blobray observation is research evidence, not an
automatic hardware-source promotion.
