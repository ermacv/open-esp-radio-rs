//! The station's thin service on a lower-MAC port: the one loop that waits
//! and carries out what the sans-IO machines decide (owner request on
//! #563).
//!
//! It polls every input source at each waiting point: the port's next event, the machines' next
//! deadline and the application (a command, or an MSDU while the data
//! machine takes one). After each input it takes every action of the
//! arbiter ([`Arbiter`]), the station ([`Station`]) and its data machine
//! ([`StaData`]) until none owes one; an answer of the arbiter goes back to
//! the station in the same step. A retune leaves the phase: the port is
//! disabled, tuned and enabled, and the arbiter hears how it went.
//! Each step consumes at most one input per source and polls all sources even
//! when RX is ready. Batches stop after eight steps and yield, so a continuous
//! RX stream cannot suppress application commands, data TX or driver progress.
//! Station requests retain the application's correlation through either a
//! synchronous `CommandRefused` or their reserved `CommandCompleted` output;
//! link notices describe lifecycle independently of application requests.
//! `event` returns a typed contract error with the rejected owners. After the
//! first violation, disable retains later terminals sealed in `TerminalCustody`;
//! none enters Station, Data, Arbiter or rate selection. Its fixed capacity is
//! checked against the backend's terminal capacity at service construction.
//! A full bank returns the next terminal to the port, which retains it and all
//! remaining owners for poisoned teardown. `run` consumes its service and returns `ServiceCompleted`:
//! the port's terminal state and separate `RetiredService` resource banks.
//! On Stop, failure or poisoned disable, Station/Data finalize without issuing
//! Configure, key or transmit effects. Accepted requests return once before the
//! lifecycle notice. Unconsumed requests remain in their application queue.
//! `FailedInstallation` retains the Disabled stop proof and permits normal
//! uninstall only; recovery constructs a new service in a new installation.
//! Its failure does not itself require hardware reset. Failed and Poisoned
//! results retain `ServiceFault`: the enable refusal, backend/submission cause,
//! or precise contract violation. The poisoned owner also retains the disable
//! cause. Stop finishes the arbiter with `ArbiterEnd::Stopped`, preserving that
//! cause in every cancelled lease and retaining its restart bank.
//! `ServiceCompleted::into_stopped` grants `StoppedService` only after ordinary
//! Stop. Its consuming `restart` reuses the same pools, epoch source, lease
//! identity frontier, gate and data admission permissions. Startup reclaims
//! old keys and receive settings before taking queued application commands.
//! Deferred EAPOL frames return separately with that bank: they belong to the
//! old association. Failed or poisoned runs have no restart continuation.
//! The loop owns the working arbiter separately from Station/Data so a failed
//! return can consume it. Finalization accepts only `RetiredArbiter`; no active
//! arbiter or placeholder state remains in the retired service.
//!
//! The tokens the machines hold are the port's: tickets and buffers of two
//! classes, the small one for the station's frames and the large one for
//! data. A completion carries `TxContext`, which routes its ticket and
//! resources to the original machine and link. Buffer classes are used
//! only to recover their memory types; `StationTxBuffer` exhaustively
//! represents both classes and both publication states at this boundary.
//! Machines receive `ReturnedMpdu::Fresh` or `Sent` and decide when to renew.
//! Cross-AC completion order has no bearing on ownership. Each machine
//! returns stale-link resources without advancing its current protocol,
//! and the service excludes those terminals from current-link rate control.
//! A data operation's closed context supplies its frame, access category and
//! checked `DataProtection`. Submission refuses a changed link or protection
//! before preparation and returns the original context, ticket and buffer.
//! Data admission is an owned permit per AC, including old-link work until
//! its terminal, and preserves the station's Voice waiting bound.
//! Preparation returns the original typed source on refusal; context and
//! ticket have not left this service. Submission can refuse only poisoning.
//! The application hears `ServiceOutput::TxRefused`; Station gets `Unsent`
//! and Data gets `Refused`. Neither path fabricates a completion or updates
//! rate statistics, and the service continues. A `Sent` return retains its
//! external body until its machine retires the MPDU; service never renews
//! a completion merely to route it. `StationPort::Types` fixes `TxBody` to
//! `Infallible`, so a returned external body is uninhabited at this boundary.
//! GTK actions move the unique mutation permission into the port. Their
//! private pending token stays here until the matching FIFO slot terminal;
//! admission never fabricates installation success. RX continues through the
//! old replay epoch while the command is pending. Configure retains its one pending token until the port
//! reports it applied; Station cannot issue another before that return.
//! Arbiter answers return their affine places/leases in the same step.
//! Commands and MSDUs use affine SPSC queues with atomic wakeups. Each
//! readiness future holds its endpoint exclusively and consumes no value;
//! a port fault leaves a simultaneously ready command in its queue. A received
//! MSDU the network's full queue cannot take is dropped, as an Ethernet
//! receiver drops one.
//! `MsduQueue::split` exclusively borrows its storage. Both endpoints retain
//! that borrow, so no second pair can coexist. After the pair returns, queued
//! values remain owned by the queue and reach the next receiver in order.
//! [`EthernetFrame`] retains its fixed header and bounded payload. Construction
//! from checked Ethernet parts returns [`FrameTooLong`] for a payload exceeding
//! [`MAX_ETHERNET_PAYLOAD_LEN`]; received payloads are never clipped. Raw-byte
//! fixture parsing and serialization do not belong to the product API.
