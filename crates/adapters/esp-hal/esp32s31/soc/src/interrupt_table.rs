//! The image's interrupt table (`oer-interrupt-table`) on the ESP32-S31
//! matrix.
//!
//! Every image declares its peripheral interrupt sources once with the
//! platform runtime's `interrupt_table!` and hands the table to the runtime,
//! which [`adopt`]s it, silences each source of a hart's entries when it
//! installs that hart's interrupt stack ([`install_current_hart`]) and checks
//! again before it enables interrupts ([`verify_current_hart`]). An owner routes
//! its source with [`enable`] and its token, and silences it with [`disable`].
//!
//! esp-hal's `static-interrupts` feature leaves the table the only owner of
//! routes: [`adopt`] takes esp-hal's one routing capability, and a driver that
//! needs its interrupt (`into_async`) only requires the image's route, which
//! [`verify_current_hart`] checks is routed before interrupts are enabled.
