//! Network traffic of HIL workloads: the target's traffic sessions over the
//! link ([`NetworkSession`]: configure, arm, start, typed evidence, replay
//! and acknowledgement), the readiness of its network services, and the
//! host side of the traffic: paced UDP and TCP generation and reception
//! ([`paced_udp`], [`paced_tcp`]) and the offered load of several flows
//! ([`offered_load`]), UDP sockets sized for qualification ([`udp`]) and ICMP
//! echo through datagram sockets ([`icmp`]), with the one nearest-rank
//! percentile ([`icmp::nearest_rank`]).
//!
//! Every station, access-point and coexistence workload measures its
//! traffic through this crate; it depends on the link and the protocol, never
//! on a radio family.
