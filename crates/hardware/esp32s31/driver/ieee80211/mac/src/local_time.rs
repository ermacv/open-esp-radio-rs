//! The Wi-Fi MAC local time on a 64-bit timeline.
//!
//! The MAC local-time counter (`WIFI_MAC_LOCAL_TIME`) counts microseconds in
//! 32 bits and wraps every 2³² µs, about 71.6 minutes; receive timestamps
//! are readings of the same counter (`rx::decode_rx_local_timestamp`). The
//! HIL scenario `diagnostic-rx-clock` established its unit and that it runs
//! at the rate of the system timer.

/// The timeline remembers its last fresh reading. A raw value is placed at
/// the timeline value nearest that reading, so a reading or a receive stamp
/// lands exactly while less than 2³¹ µs (about 35.8 minutes) lies between
/// it and the last reading: the owner reads the counter at least that
