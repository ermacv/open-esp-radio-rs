//! Vendor station power management for one associated station.
//!
//! This is the connected-station part of the vendor power manager
//! (`libpp.a[pm.o]`, `pm_coex.o`) as an executor-independent state machine.
//! Every input is one vendor entry point; every effect is a [`PmAction`] the
//! caller performs in order: frames to send, coexistence requests, TX queue
//! gating, RF sleep and wake, timers and the station TBTT schedule.
//!
//! Under active coexistence a station follows the schedule's Wi-Fi slices
//! even when power save is off: it advertises power save and blocks its TX
//! queues when its slice ends, wakes at its next slice or beacon, and
//! requests the air for its slice, its beacon window and buffered traffic.
//! Without coexistence, sleep type `None` keeps the station awake and the
//! modem sleep types follow the DTIM or the listen interval.
//!
//! Only an associated station is modelled. The vendor's disconnected power
//! save, connectionless wake windows, TWT, mesh and hardware beacon
//! monitoring are separate features and absent here.
//!
//! SOURCE: complete pinned `libpp.a[pm.o]` and `libpp.a[pm_coex.o]` of
//! espressif/esp32-wifi-lib `af55a0ca`; each method names the function it
//! follows.
