//! The peripheral connections created by connection indications, one per
//! slot.
//!
//! A connection opens the backend's connection, reports LE Connection
//! Complete and then listens at every connection event: the first across the
//! transmit window the indication set, later ones at the anchor the last
//! received packet fixed, widened for clock drift. The next event is planned
//! when the previous one ended; events that can no longer be admitted in time,
//! or that would find no room in the Host output for their receptions, are
//! skipped. While events are skipped for lack of room the supervision timeout
//! still runs against the current time, so a Host that withholds its credits
//! loses the connection with Disconnection Complete `0x08`. Peripheral latency is not used: the peripheral listens at every
//! event it plans.
//!
//! Between events at most one PDU waits for the central's acknowledgement.
//! The next one is chosen in this order: an encryption procedure response,
//! a Link Layer control response or request, then the next fragment of the
//! Host ACL packet in progress, as long as the effective transmit length of the
//! Data Length Update allows; an encrypted fragment leaves room for its MIC.
//! While encryption is being started, paused or restarted only its own
//! responses and a required termination may be sent. A new connection starts
//! the Data Length Update when the Host suggested a longer default.
//!
//! Received packets are authenticated first, then dispatched to the control
//! procedures or delivered to the Host as ACL data. A Channel Map Update or
//! Connection Update waits for the event to end and then enters the Link
//! Layer's pending instant.
//!
//! The connection ends when the central's `LL_TERMINATE_IND` arrives, when the
//! central acknowledged a local `LL_TERMINATE_IND`, when the supervision
//! timeout passes without a received packet, when six events pass without
//! establishment, at once with `0x3D` and without a terminate when a received
//! packet fails its MIC or the encryption procedure, or on Reset. The event in progress is cancelled, the
//! backend's connection is closed and Disconnection Complete follows, except
//! after Reset.
