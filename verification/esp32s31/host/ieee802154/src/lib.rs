//! Host differential stand for the ESP32-S31 IEEE 802.15.4 driver port.
//!
//! The pinned public ESP-IDF driver is compiled unmodified for the host (see
//! `build.rs`). Its register layer (`ieee802154_ll_*`), the closed PHY, BTBB
//! and coexistence calls, modem clocks, interrupt allocation, time and the
//! application callbacks are replaced by recorders. A [`Scenario`] drives the
//! public API and delivers interrupts through the handler the driver
//! registered; [`scenario::run`] returns the resulting boundary trace.
//! [`port::run`] drives the production engine through the same scenario and
//! [`compare`] reports `MATCH`, `DIFF` or `INCOMPLETE`.
//!
//! The compiled driver keeps its state in C globals. One process therefore
//! runs one scenario, which [`claim`] enforces; the
//! `oer-esp32s31-ieee802154-vendor-host` binary runs a named catalog scenario
//! per invocation.
