//! Static storage retained by the ESP32-S31 BLE PHY engine.
//!
//! The recovered register-initialization transaction publishes two addresses:
//! a `0x68`-byte BLE environment, three tables referenced by its positional
//! pointer fields, and a controller-SRAM resolving-list object allocated in
//! `0x40`-byte units. The BLE PHY module initialization copies the reviewed
//! channel-frequency and receive packet-start calibration tables into those
//! allocations. The register transaction publishes one environment member at
//! `+0x2c` and the start of a subregion at `+0x40`. This module owns the
//! complete recovered allocation graph and its stable location. It
//! deliberately does not assign semantics to still-unrecovered words or grant
//! MMIO publication authority.
