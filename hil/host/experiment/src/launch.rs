//! The one way a run is launched: [`launch_run`].
//!
//! Whoever starts a runner (a `cargo hil run`, an A/B arm, a bisection
//! step) describes it as a [`Launch`]; the runner executable runs
//! supervised, with cancellation forwarded and a shutdown grace for fixture
//! cleanup and sealing, and the runs it created come back from its run
//! receipt ([`oer_hil_run_bundle::receipt`]), never from the store's newest
//! directories. No launcher runs `cargo hil`.
