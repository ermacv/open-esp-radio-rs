# ESP32-S31 staged application boot

This platform composes ESP-HAL for ESP32-S31-Function-CoreBoard-1. Both the
standalone examples and HIL consume it; it has no HIL protocol, scenario,
radio role, executor or network-stack dependency.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `board` | Board-specific 16-MiB PSRAM at 250 MHz and 16-MiB Flash configuration; adoption of the live mapping |
| `bootstrap` | Flash entry, PSRAM initialization, image validation/CRC, relocation, Flash tuning and non-returning handoff |
| `runtime` | Stage-two entry, SRAM section initialization, mapping adoption, vector handoff, per-core interrupt stacks and the image's one panic entry |
| `layout` | Address map, the stage-two placement and the stage-two header/checksum shared with the host packer and auditor |
| `linker` | Semantic code, data, DMA and stack sections over the `layout` symbols |
| `partitions` | Application partition layout |
| `stack.toml` | Stack policy: each stack's root function, storage and reserve, the move limit and the frame-coverage review (`stack-coverage.toml`); HIL extends it |

The runtime owns every image's `#[panic_handler]`. It writes a bounded record
of the panic to `.rtc_fast.persistent` without formatting (the end of the
location's file path, line, column, the start of the message when it is a
static string, hart and, on an interrupt stack, the interrupted PC), so the
panic path stays a short leaf in every stack bound. An image with
`panic-hook` defines `oer_platform_panic_hook`, which the entry calls after
the record to record more of its own state the same way; it returns. Every
image then resets, and its next boot reads and clears the record with
`panic::take_previous` and prints it.
The hook receives `panic::PanicDetails`, rather than the original `PanicInfo`.
Interrupt-context panics retain hart and interrupted PC, but omit location and
message: compiler metadata can live in cached PSRAM. Task-context panics keep
their metadata because their code and stack already require the live mapping.
The hook and all state it reads must stay in SRAM or retained memory and take
no locks. The final-image gate checks compiler panic entries, the handler,
the hook and their resolved callees for cached code.
The hook's static data references, including compiler-created constants, are
checked through the ELF relocations as well.

Every image of this platform, standalone or HIL, is built by the one image
pipeline, [`oer-image`](../../tools/image/pipeline/README.md), with the compiler flags
of `oer-toolchain`'s `image` module; no `.cargo/config.toml` adds Rust
flags.

The boot sequence is ROM → ESP-IDF bootloader → Flash bootstrap → application.
The ROM image uses DIO at 80 MHz; ESP-IDF enables QIO for the application.
The image pipeline encodes the flash contents at build time with the
`espflash` library: the ROM-readable DIO bootloader from `espflash`'s
bootloader resources (checked), the partition table, the audited QIO
application and the `ota_0` selection, at the offsets of `chip.toml`'s
`[flash]` map. A flash writes them as raw segments through one connection,
skipping segments whose flash contents already match; the selection goes
last. It preserves NVS and other application partitions. Encoding the
bootloader in QIO with the application would change the ROM image header and
prevent this board from booting.
The bootstrap finds its payload through the flash MMU, so an application
boots from any OTA slot.
The runtime is linked separately. Its header supplies the entry, payload and
initialization ranges; the host packs the checksum before embedding it in the
bootstrap. Bootstrap copies and verifies PSRAM code before transferring control.
It does not return or carry Rust peripheral owners across the image boundary.

Stage-two assembly initializes application data and SRAM interrupt/DMA sections
before entering `runtime_main`. The application calls `esp_hal::init`, then
unsafely adopts the bootstrap mapping through `oer_esp32s31_platform_runtime::adopt_psram`
with its unique PSRAM token. This also reinitializes vectoring and installs the
per-core SRAM interrupt stack. Global interrupts remain disabled until the
application binds its timers and executor handlers; it then calls the unsafe
`oer_esp32s31_platform_runtime::enable_interrupts_after_handoff` once per hart. PSRAM
must not be reset or remapped after handoff.
The runtime is the only owner of each hart's active vector table (MTVT):
every CPU interrupt enters through its stack-switching vector entry and
esp-hal's shared dispatcher. The esp-hal fork only vectors the
inter-processor call's line (CLINT software interrupt 3) and runs the posted
function from that dispatcher, instead of writing its own handler into the
slot; `enable_interrupts_after_handoff` panics when any hardware-vector slot
differs from the runtime's entries, so a later direct binding cannot run on
the interrupted stack. HIL's `system-ipc-call` calls each core.

Each image declares its peripheral interrupt sources once with
`oer_esp32s31_platform_runtime::interrupt_table!` (source, handler, level,
core; see [`oer-interrupt-table`](../../crates/runtime/interrupt-table/README.md)):
the macro links each handler into its source's slot of esp-hal's
`__EXTERNAL_INTERRUPTS` and creates one token per source; the image hands its `INTERRUPT_TABLE` to
`adopt_psram`. Each 12-byte entry holds the `Interrupt` (`u16`), the
`Priority` (`u8`), the `Cpu` (a 4-byte C enum at offset 4) and the handler
address at offset 8 (zero for an entry a `cfg` leaves out); compile-time
assertions in `interrupts.rs` keep that layout, which the stack analysis
reads. The interrupt-stack gate requires every entry's slot
symbol, and the handler it calls unless the handler is inlined into it, in
SRAM. Installing a hart's
interrupt stack silences every source of that hart's entries and checks the
slots; `enable_interrupts_after_handoff` checks again that every slot holds its
handler and every table source is silent or routed to its level. An owner
routes its source with `oer_esp32s31_soc_esp_hal::interrupt_table::enable` and
its token, on the table's core only, and silences it with `disable`; the
matrix lives in that adapter so that owners in `crates/` reach it. The stack analysis does not
yet fail a table entry whose `enable` no root of the image reaches. HIL's
`system-interrupt-table` checks that a source stays silent until enabled and
after it is disabled. esp-hal's PMP region setup
(`ESP_HAL_CONFIG_ENABLE_PMP`) is off in the root Cargo configuration, because
its single no-execute data region would span stage two's PSRAM code.

Every image uses one placement: PSRAM for code, ordinary data and a 192-KiB
CPU0 task stack; SRAM for interrupt entries, hot code, critical state, DMA
storage and two 32-KiB interrupt stacks. HIL also selects a 16-KiB CPU1 task
stack through the `multicore` runtime feature; its CPU startup policy and
second-core application entry remain in HIL. These board sizes are not
universal chip capabilities.

Because code runs from PSRAM, the adopted mapping keeps the PSRAM function
clock, and through it MPLL, referenced in ESP-HAL's clock tree for the life of
the image. A driver that releases MPLL therefore never powers it down under
PSRAM.

## Boot state on the board

The [boot-state probe](../../verification/esp32s31/hardware/boot-state-probe/README.md)
reads what the bootloader leaves and what esp-hal relies on:

- The `espflash`-bundled ESP-IDF bootloader already programs PMA entry 7 as
  the locked 64 MiB NAPOT external-memory aperture at `0x5000_0000`, the
  value esp-hal's `pre_init` writes; entry 15 covers the flash window
  `0x4000_0000` (512 MiB), entries 12-14 the internal memories, and entry 8 is
  unused. Newer ESP-IDF bootloaders that put the flash window top in entry 7
  would conflict with esp-hal's locked write.
- A Flash MMU entry implements bits 0-10 and 13 of the content word: the
  page-number field the PAC publishes as 10 bits (`PADDR`, with bit 10 as
  `ACCESS_SPIRAM`) is the 11-bit value mask of ESP-IDF's `ext_mem_defs.h`;
  a read-back cannot tell which meaning bit 10 has, and the production
  translation reads 10 bits, enough for 64 MiB of flash.
- `PMU.IMM_HP_CK_POWER_1` reads zero after its tie-high and tie-low bits are
  written: they are write-only pulses, not state.
- After ESP-IDF's `rng_ll_enable` sequence, which pulses the block reset
  after setting it, `TRNG.DATE.CLK_EN` reads zero while the TRNG still
  produces changing output; ESP-IDF's `rng_ll_is_enabled` checks only the
  LP clock and reset, and so does `entropy::source_status`.
- Disabling the TIMG watchdog through esp-hal holds: no reset arrives past
  the armed timeout.

## Brownout detector policy

The ESP-IDF bootloader leaves its analog mode-1 brownout reset armed. The
bootstrap replaces it once, right after `esp_hal::init` and before the
application runs, with ESP-IDF's application policy, as `esp_brownout_init`
does at startup: mode 0 at level 7 (about 2.4 V), with the hardware reset,
flash power-down and RF power-down, and no brownout interrupt (the ESP32-S31
has no `ESP_BROWNOUT_USE_INTR`). A brownout still resets the chip; the
policy sets the threshold and powers the flash and RF down before the reset.

The bootstrap then reads the detector's mode, actions and waits back and
prints `OER_BOOT bootstrap=BROWNOUT`, or stops with
`reason=brownout-policy`, so every boot checks it; the threshold is an
analog register esp-hal writes but cannot read back. Every image boots
through the bootstrap, so the detector is configured before the
application, and before the radio platform takes the analog bus
([#313](https://github.com/ermacv/open-esp-radio-rs/issues/313)). Rejected:
keeping the bootloader's mode-1 reset, a project-specific level, action or
interrupt, and applying the policy in the radio platform constructor, which
pulled esp-hal's critical section into the vendor-compared PHY probe;
disabling the detector is never an option.

## Recovery after a lockup

An application can leave LP/PMU state behind that survives a watchdog reset,
the USB-Serial-JTAG (RTS) reset and a reflash: on 2026-09-28 a CPU lockup with
MPLL powered down left the ESP-IDF bootloader looping on
`rst:0x7 HP_SYS_HP_WDT0_RESET` after `Multicore bootloader`. A system reset
through the built-in USB-JTAG (OpenOCD `reset run`, reported by the ROM as
`rst:0x3 SW_SYS_RESET`) cleared it; this board has no EN line wired to the
host. The HIL runner applies that escalation itself (see the
[runner's boot-loop recovery](../../hil/host/README.md)); a board that none of
its resets clears is quarantined for a person.

Each dedicated IRQ stack is painted once during its first installation, before
IRQ admission. Reinstalling vectors preserves the paint. Thread-mode callers
can sample only their current hart through
`stacks::current_hart_interrupt_stack_free_bytes`; it masks local interrupts
for the bounded SRAM scan and restores their prior enable state. It rejects
sampling from the IRQ stack or before initialization. Measurements describe
observed writes, not the maximum possible depth or unwritten stack reservations.
The maximum is the image build's interrupt-stack gate: a static bound per hart
from the image's interrupt table ([image pipeline](../../tools/image/pipeline/README.md)),
under the contract `layout`'s `interrupts` module states. Each HIL repetition
holds the two to each other: its peak watermark use per hart is recorded as
`stack.cpuN-irq.used`, evaluated at most the bound the current analyzer
computes from the run's archived runtime ELF, and a use above it (a path the
analysis missed) fails the repetition, as does an analysis that cannot run. A
hart the analysis leaves `partial + ?` (a diagnostic image) is only observed:
that number is no bound to hold a watermark to.

From the repository root:

```console
cargo fw build monitor
cargo fw build station
cargo fw flash --device <MAC|PORT> --monitor target/firmware/esp32s31-station/build-<id>
```

Select `station`, `access-point`, `monitor` or `thread`. Application
credentials remain environment configuration of the example; HIL credentials
remain stand file. Each successful invocation retains a separate image bundle
under `target/firmware/esp32s31-<example>/build-<id>/`:
`application.bin`, ROM `bootloader.bin`, `partitions.bin`, `otadata.bin`,
the slot partition table, packed runtime, `runtime.elf`, `bootstrap.elf`,
both resolved lockfiles, `source-inputs.json` and placement/stack reports;
`cargo fw flash` writes it to an attached board (`cargo fw flash station` builds and writes in one step). The build rejects invalid placement and a stack whose
root's call-chain bound does not fit its storage less its reserve before flash.
A task stack's bound may be partial (the executor's task polls are indirect
calls the analysis does not resolve); its report names every unresolved site,
and runtime stack painting and boundary watchpoints check the exercised
chains.

The [image pipeline](../../tools/image/pipeline/README.md) supplies packing,
structural checks and encoding to `cargo fw` and HIL. HIL retains its image classification,
observer placement requirements, stack budgets and sealed evidence. Source or
image checks alone do not establish RF qualification.
