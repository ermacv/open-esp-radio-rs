//! The channel of a port that a station and an access point share.
//!
//! One radio serves both interfaces, so the port has one channel. The
//! station's BSS (the upstream) decides it: the access point beside the
//! station follows the upstream wherever its [`ApFollowPolicy`] lets it.
//! The [`ChannelCoordinator`] decides each move and the port's owner carries
//! it out: the coordinator takes the station's and the access point's facts
//! as values and answers with [`CoordinatorAction`]s; it has no clock,
//! executor or port of its own.
//!
//! - **The upstream announces a move.** The access point announces the same
//!   move to its peers, counting the beacons it still sends before the
//!   upstream's switch instant, in the upstream's mode; when not one fits,
//!   it counts one and tells its peers to stop transmitting. The port moves
//!   once, at the access point's TBTT where its switch is due: the station
//!   follows the upstream at most one beacon interval late.
//! - **The upstream goes where the access point may not follow** (a band
//!   outside the policy's, or a channel that needs radar detection,
//!   [`requires_radar_detection`]): the policy's [`ApUnservable`] decides
//!   whether the access point stops or the station leaves the upstream.
//! - **The upstream is lost without an announcement.** The access point
//!   keeps its channel and the station searches for the upstream in short
//!   absences from it, one after each of the access point's TBTTs while the
//!   search is dense, one about every [`ApSearchPolicy::sparse_interval`]
//!   after that. Found on the access point's channel, the station joins it
//!   again; found elsewhere, the access point announces the move first.
//! - **The upstream stays lost.** An [`UpstreamLossPolicy`] bounds the
//!   search: [`UpstreamLossPolicy::after`] the loss, the access point stops,
//!   the station scans alone and joins the upstream, and the access point
//!   starts on the upstream's channel. A scan that finds none starts the
//!   access point again on its previous channel, and the next attempt
//!   follows `after` later ([`ChannelCoordinator::upstream_rescan`]).
