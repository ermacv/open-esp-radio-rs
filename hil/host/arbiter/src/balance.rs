//! Owner balances: who has waited more than they used.
//!
//! Every owner has a balance. Each lease it holds charges it the time held;
//! while a request of it waits because of another owner, behind that
//! owner's lease or a request of that owner served before it, it is credited
//! the time waited, once however many requests it has queued. Waiting behind
//! its own lease earns nothing, so an owner that queues more work behind its
//! running lease is still charged for it. Balances decay with a two-hour
//! half-life and are clamped to an hour either way, so old debt fades. Every
//! settlement subtracts the mean over the owners active in the last day, so
//! the sum stays near zero without a jump at each grant.
//! The grantable request whose owner has the highest balance is served
//! first, the earlier one on a tie; divisible work of an owner with a lower
//! balance than a waiter it blocks yields after a minimum slice.
