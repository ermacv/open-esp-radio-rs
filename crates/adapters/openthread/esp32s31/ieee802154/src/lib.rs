//! The [`openthread`] crate's `Radio` over the ESP32-S31 IEEE 802.15.4
//! runtime.
//!
//! It builds on `openthread-radio`, the C-free trait crate of the
//! repository's fork of that crate (<https://github.com/ermacv/openthread>,
//! branch `oer/main`), whose trait also carries OpenThread's MAC
//! keys, frame counter and per-frame transmit information. The radio reports
//! the capabilities ESP-IDF's OpenThread port reports: hardware acknowledgement with its timeout, address filtering,
//! promiscuous mode, source matching for frame pending, energy scan,
//! transmission from sleep, transmit security and timed transmission and
//! reception for Coordinated Sampled Listening. As in the port,
//! OpenThread's `SubMac` runs CSMA-CA backoffs and retries itself; each of
//! its attempts reaches the radio as one transmission with or without a
//! CCA, which the radio secures with OpenThread's keys and a frame counter
//! of its own. 2015 frames are answered with enhanced ACKs, secured ones
//! with the same keys and counter.
