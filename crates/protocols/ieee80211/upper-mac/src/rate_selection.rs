//! The rates of every frame one interface sends: a sans-IO machine above
//! the lower-MAC port ([owner decision on #563]).
//!
//! The service asks it for the retry plan of each frame by what the frame
//! is for ([`FrameRates`]) and hands it every terminal of those frames
//! ([`RateSelection::completed`]): the rates and transmissions the attempt
//! made teach it the next plan. It hears when its interface associates
//! with a peer and when it leaves: a controller adapts per peer. The selection is an integrator's policy;
//! the Espressif one (`oer-espressif-ieee80211-policy::rate_selection`)
//! sends as the vendor's station does.
