#![no_std]
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Executor-independent service loop of the Bluetooth LE Controller.
//!
//! [`serve`] moves packets and radio work between three owners: the
//! Controller end of an in-process HCI transport, the sans-IO
//! [`LeController`] core and one [`LeRadioBackend`], which the protocol
//! package `oer-bluetooth-radio` declares. It runs as the body of the
//! backend's port ([`PortBody`]): [`run_port`] hands it the port's owner
//! disabled, and it returns the owner's [`Ended`].
//!
//! The body enables the port, serves one phase and then disables and
//! uninstalls it. While it serves, it publishes the core's queued packets,
//! takes the next Host command when the core is ready for one, submits the
//! core's radio requests one at a time through the phase's client and feeds
//! every radio outcome back. A refused request is retried after
//! [`REFUSED_RETRY_DELAY`] or the next outcome or command. The core plans
//! only what the backend's capabilities ([`LeRadioBackend::Caps`]) serve,
//! so no request is refused as outside them. Whenever the core's
//! [`RadioActivity`] changes, the body reports it through the phase's
//! control before doing anything else.
//!
//! The body owns no memory of its own beyond one command buffer and spawns
//! nothing; [`run_port`] joins it with the backend's driver in the task the
//! caller polls it on. It stops serving when the caller's `stop`
//! completes, when the transport closes or fails, when the radio's clock
//! cannot be read, or when the radio epoch is exhausted ([`ServeExit`]).
//! The backend reserves every event's end and a connection event's data
//! when it admits the event, so an [`EventsLost`] stands for advertising
//! and scan reports only and the body goes on: the core's roles still
//! account every event by its end. Host ACL data enters the core while it
//! has room for a packet; until then commands pass queued data.
//!
//! The radio epoch is exhausted when a fresh sample lies past its end
//! ([`ClockError::EpochExhausted`], [`RequestError::EpochExhausted`]) or a
//! required continuation of the core's schedule lies outside it
//! ([`EpochExhausted`]): no later sample brings either back, so the body
//! submits nothing more, retries nothing and stops serving.
//!
//! The owner's `disable`, bounded by the backend, then hands every event
//! the phase left to the core: each admitted event ends exactly once, with
//! its real completion when it ran. The caller then receives the
//! backend's uninstalled hardware and a core that accounted every event,
//! ready for the Host epoch's retirement. A backend poisoned while serving
//! ([`Served::Poisoned`]) or while disabling ([`Served::DisableFailed`]) is
//! drained and uninstalled with its cause. The driver retains its hardware
//! owners until that uninstall. Only a missed retirement bound fail-stops
//! the port; `PortEnd` distinguishes that result from abandonment.
