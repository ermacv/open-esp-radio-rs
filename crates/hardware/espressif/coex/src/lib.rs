#![no_std]
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Executor-neutral coexistence policy of the Espressif chips, recovered from
//! esp-coex-lib.
//!
//! Register ownership deliberately lives outside this crate. Each chip's
//! radio arbiter owns its COEX timer bank, its [`CoexPtiTable`] and its
//! shared modem clock fields; this crate is the policy that drives them
//! through its ports ([`CoexTimerHardware`], [`CoexClockHardware`]).
//! [`CoexCore`] programs event requests on the timer bank; [`CoexSchedule`]
//! is the recovered time-slice schedule that selects a scheme from the
//! radios' status and steps its phases; [`CoexScheduleExecutor`] adds its
//! phase timer. A chip crate binds the ports to its HAL.
//!
//! The portable client and priority vocabulary is `oer-radio-coex`:
//! [`CoexClient`], [`CoexStatusType`] and [`Ieee802154CoexLevel`] convert
//! from it into the vendor's request kinds, status words and table events.
