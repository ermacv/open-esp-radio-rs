/// A Bluetooth LE radio backend, as a Controller service body drives it
/// through its port owner ([`oer_radio_port::Owner`]).
///
/// The lifecycle is the owner's: its disabled owner enables the port, an
/// enabled one lends one running phase of three parts and disables the port
/// within the backend's bound, handing every admitted event's end to the
/// body. An LE radio has no channel to retune, so nothing refuses `Enable`
/// ([`PortBackend::Refusal`] is [`Infallible`]). A phase's parts are the one event consumer
/// ([`PortBackend::Phase`]), the control that publishes the active roles
/// to a coexistence arbiter ([`Self::activity`]) and the client of the
/// Controller core ([`Self::submit`], [`Self::cancel`], [`Self::client_now`]),
/// which exists only while the port is enabled: no request is refused as
/// disabled.
///
/// Its capabilities are a type ([`Self::Caps`]), known when the image is
/// built, with the [`RadioTiming`](crate::RadioTiming) a planner keeps
/// reservations apart by. A request carries values checked against them
/// ([`crate::Supported`]), so the backend refuses nothing they exclude; it
/// refuses what the world decides ([`RequestError::Late`] when time passed
/// between placing a request and its admission, the clock, the epoch) and
/// what its role state holds now. The outer
/// [`Poisoned`](oer_radio_port::Poisoned) means the backend's state is
/// unknown, with its cause: every later call returns it and only a reset
/// restores the port.
///
/// # Events
///
/// The phase's one consumer takes the events; the backend's scheduler work
/// runs in its driver ([`PortBackend::drive`]), which
/// [`run_port`](oer_radio_port::run_port) joins with the body. The backend reserves the slots of an
/// admitted event's end ([`RadioOutcome::EventEnded`], with the
/// [`RadioOutcome::TransmitAcknowledged`] or [`RadioOutcome::TestReport`]
/// before it) and of the data PDUs a connection event receives (the Link
/// Layer promises the peer reliable delivery of what the hardware
/// acknowledged) when it admits them, so they are never lost;
/// [`EventsLost`] stands for advertising and scan reports only.
///
/// Submission and the clock are asynchronous because a backend may have to
/// wait for hardware to admit a request: the ESP32-S31 takes a fresh
/// controller-time latch for every request and every clock reading, which
/// completes only after the hardware latched the time, and its driver
/// serves a request between its scheduler passes. Neither wait depends on
/// the caller; both end within the backend's own bounds.
///
/// Who acknowledges data PDUs is part of the capabilities: either way the
/// port carries only LLID and payload, reports
/// [`RadioOutcome::TransmitAcknowledged`] once the peer acknowledged the
/// connection's queued PDU and reports only new, non-empty receptions.
///
/// # Dropping a call
///
/// A call's future may be dropped. A backend that admits in the caller's
/// future admits nothing then. A backend whose driver admits (the
/// ESP32-S31's) withdraws a request its driver has not taken, so nothing
/// happens; a request the driver took it serves to the end: its effects
/// stand (an admitted event's end reaches the event consumer as any other
/// event's) and its reply is discarded, never given to the next call. The
/// Controller service body drops no call.
///
/// # One client call at a time
///
/// The client's calls take it by `&mut`, so a backend serves one of them
/// at a time and needs no queue of callers; two at once do not compile:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0499
/// use oer_bluetooth_radio::{EventId, LeRadioBackend, NoRadio, NoRadioPart};
/// fn twice(client: &mut NoRadioPart) {
///     let first = NoRadio::cancel(client, EventId::new(1));
///     let second = NoRadio::cancel(client, EventId::new(2));
///     drop((first, second));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Its compiling twin finishes the first call before the second:
///
/// ```
/// use oer_bluetooth_radio::{EventId, LeRadioBackend, NoRadio, NoRadioPart};
/// async fn in_turn(client: &mut NoRadioPart) {
///     let _ = NoRadio::cancel(client, EventId::new(1)).await;
///     let _ = NoRadio::cancel(client, EventId::new(2)).await;
/// }
