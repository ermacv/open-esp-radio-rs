//! Bringing back a device under test that stopped answering.
//!
//! When a failed repetition's target does not answer the post-mortem query,
//! or its bootloader resets in a loop, the runner climbs the board's ladder
//! ([`oer_device_reset::climb`]): the resets of its stand-file `reset` ladder
//! in order, then, for a board that resets by power, the automatic entry into
//! its ROM's download mode. The first step after which the firmware answers
//! is journaled as a recovery; it counts as hardware-level when the port had
//! vanished or the ROM was waiting for a download, which firmware cannot
//! cause. Every step is kept in the repetition's `post-mortem/recovery.json`
//! or `reset-escalation.json`.
//!
//! A board is quarantined only when no step brings it back to a state in
//! which firmware can be loaded: its ROM stays silent. A ROM that answers,
//! booting from flash or waiting for a download, means the stand can reflash
//! the board, however bad its firmware; such a board is never quarantined.
//! A quarantined board serves nobody until a person resets or power-cycles
//! it. What the stand saw is kept in the repetition's `post-mortem/`, which
//! the quarantine names.
