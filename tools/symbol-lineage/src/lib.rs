//! Recover vendor function names across obfuscated archive revisions.
//!
//! An early vendor archive can carry source function names that later
//! revisions replace with generated tokens. [`lineage::trace`] pairs the
//! functions of every adjacent revision pair ([`correspond`]) and carries each
//! source name forward to the final revision, retaining the evidence of every
//! step. A function without a complete chain keeps no recovered name.
