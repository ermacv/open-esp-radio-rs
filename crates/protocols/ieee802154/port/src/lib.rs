//! The lifecycle of the IEEE 802.15.4 radio port: the one authority over an installed
//! port, as types. The IEEE 802.15.4 block owns it; the vocabulary it shares with
//! the other radio blocks (the brand and [`Mint`], slots, permits and
//! seats, [`Poisoned`], [`PortResult`], [`EventsLost`], the clock
//! relation) stays in `oer-radio-port`.
//!
//! Every rule a caller controls is a type here, so breaking it does not
//! compile ([ownership and refusals]); only what the world controls (the
//! air, time, the hardware, a peer, the arbiter) stays a typed outcome.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! A port lives inside one body ([`PortBody`]) that [`run_port`] runs over a
//! backend ([`PortBackend`]), joined with the backend's driver
//! ([below](#the-driver)); no caller ever holds the backend. The body
//! receives an [`Owner`] in the [`Disabled`] state and must return
//! [`Ended`], which only the uninstalls and the `fail_stop`s construct, so
//! a body that drops or forgets its owner does not compile. The owner's
//! state is its type (`'p` is its borrow of the install `run_port` keeps,
//! `'id` the install's brand):
//!
//! ```text
//! Owner<'p, 'id, B, Disabled> ── enable(self).await ──▶ Ok(Owner<'p, 'id, B, Enabled>)
//!        ▲                                    Err(Failed::Refused(Owner<'p, 'id, B, Disabled>, refusal))
//!        │                                    Err(Failed::Poisoned(PoisonedOwner<'p, 'id, B>))
//!        └── Ok ── disable(self, sink).await ── Owner<'p, 'id, B, Enabled>
//!                  Err(PoisonedOwner<'p, 'id, B>)
//! uninstall / fail_stop ──▶ Ended<'id, B>
//! ```
//!
//! - [`Owner<'p, 'id, B, Disabled>`](Owner) lends the protocol's disabled-only
//!   settings ([`Owner::setup`]: a permanent channel move, interface
//!   configuration, port-lifetime resources such as keys and agreements,
//!   whose tokens the owner keeps and lends into each phase), and is the
//!   only state that asks for the uninstall.
//! - [`Owner<'p, 'id, B, Enabled>`](Owner) lends one running phase at a time
//!   ([`Owner::split`]): the phase's one event consumer, its control and
//!   its interface-scoped clients, each a [`Lent`] of the owner's borrow.
//! - The transitions take the owner by value and are bounded by contract:
//!   each ends within its backend's bound, or as poisoned. An unbounded wait
//!   (the radio arbiter's lease) is a separate, cancel-safe step before the
//!   transition, which takes its result. `disable` hands every leftover
//!   terminal of a phase's work, with what it returns, to its `sink`, and
//!   ends only when every permit is back.
//! - [`PoisonedOwner`] is the one exit of a poisoned backend: its cause,
//!   its uninstall or its fail-stop.
//! - An uninstall only asks: the body returns its [`Ended`], and
//!   [`run_port`] takes the backend apart ([below](#the-driver)).
//!
//! A command never meets another command, a phase never meets a lifecycle
//! command, a disabled-only setting never meets an enabled port and an
//! enabled port is never uninstalled: there is no lifecycle refusal and no
//! "port enabled", "port disabled" or "port running" refusal. A refused
//! `Enable` (the radio refused it) is the world's outcome and returns the
//! disabled owner.
//!
//! # What types guarantee
//!
//! | Guarantee | Enforced by |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | A port ends through an uninstall or a fail-stop | the body returns [`Ended`], which only they construct |
//! | A caller holds an owner only inside a body | [`Owner`] has no public constructor |
//! | A disabled port lends no phase; an enabled one no disabled-only setting and no uninstall | the state parameter |
//! | One lifecycle command at a time; no phase or setting while one runs | the transitions take the owner by value |
//! | A phase's parts end before any owner call or transition | [`Lent`], invariant in the owner's borrow |
//! | One running phase, one event consumer | `split(&mut self)` |
//! | A caller reaches the backend only through the owner and its parts | the owner's private field |
//! | Admitted work names only its own phase's work | [`Work`] borrows its client |
//! | Admitted work ends only through the client that admitted it | [`Work`] holds that client and its token, which nothing takes out |
//! | A part or a token is not taken out of its loan | `Lent` and `Work` give nothing away; see below |
//!
//! Each line has a compile-fail test below, pinned to its error code, with a
//! compiling twin.
//!
//! # What each backend proves
//!
//! The language cannot express three rules, so every backend proves them of
//! its own types:
//!
//! - its phase parts and every token it mints (admitted work, permits,
//!   seats, leases, installed keys and agreements, validated values) are not
//!   `Clone`, `Copy` or `Default` and have no public constructor, so a
//!   mutable reference cannot exchange a part out of its loan
//!   (compile-fail tests);
//! - everything that can act on the port borrows the phase part it came
//!   from (compile-fail tests); received data and returned bodies act on
//!   nothing and may outlive it;
//! - everything the hardware touches (descriptors, DMA buffers, key tables)
//!   is `'static` and owned by the port, so no abandoned owner is ever a
//!   memory-safety issue.
//!
//! # Port-lifetime and phase-scoped tokens
//!
//! A resource that outlives a phase (an installed key, an agreement, a
//! configured interface) has its token kept by the owner and lent into each
//! phase. Admitted work is phase-scoped: [`Work`] borrows its client. The
//! pools of the permits work holds (a transmit slot, a terminal-event cell)
//! live in the backend's held part of the install, which outlives every
//! phase: a submission moves its permit into the backend, which gives it
//! back to its pool when the work ends and before it hands the terminal
//! out, so no queue overflows, no terminal is lost and no caller holds the
//! permit of submitted work; only unsolicited reception may lose events.
//! A taker waits for a permit with its own seat in the pool's line, which
//! the body's resources hand it with its client and which it keeps across
//! takes, so the line holds a place for every taker and serves them in
//! arrival order. A `'static` sans-IO core holds no
//! phase-scoped token: the phase keeps a boundary table from the core's own
//! identity to the token, which carries out the core's decisions.
//!
//! # Drop
//!
//! Rust's types are affine: an owner can be dropped and `mem::forget` is
//! safe. A body cannot do either and still end, and it runs as an executor
//! task that is not cancelled; inside it, the phase's parts run under
//! `join` over disjoint borrows. An owner is dropped only by a panic (on the
//! target, a reset) or by a body raced outside its task. Its `Drop` is a
//! safety net, as [`PlatformClockGuard`]'s: it calls
//! [`PortBackend::abandon`] (close transmission, mask interrupts, refuse any
//! new install until a reset) and asserts in debug builds; it is never the
//! shutdown.
//!
//! # Several executor tasks
//!
//! A borrow does not cross executor tasks. The port's parts stay inside its
//! body's task; another task (a network stack) talks to the body as to an
//! actor, by owned requests and replies. A handle shared between tasks over
//! an internal mutex is not a form of this contract.
//!
//! # The driver
//!
//! [`run_port`] joins the body with the backend's driver
//! ([`PortBackend::drive`]), its runner, in the body's task, and polls both
//! at every wake until the body ends. So the driver's progress never
//! depends on what the body awaits (a foreign future, a permit the driver
//! itself frees), and a body takes on no liveness duty. The driver runs for
//! the body's whole life, enabled or disabled, and reaches the install only
//! through the backend's held part ([`PortBackend::Held`]) in one of two
//! forms:
//!
//! - **Messages:** the driver owns the backend's state by value (its radio
//!   role and hardware), and the parts reach it through a request channel,
//!   an outcome queue and wakes in `Held`; it returns that state
//!   ([`PortBackend::State`]) when it retires.
//! - **Direct:** the state is in `Held`, which the parts reach
//!   synchronously, and the driver serves it there and returns `()`.
//!
//! The uninstall is `run_port`'s, because a driver still pending holds the
//! state and borrows `Held`. [`Owner::uninstall`] and
//! [`PoisonedOwner::uninstall`] only record the request in the [`Ended`]
//! they return. Once the body returned it, `run_port`:
//!
//! 1. asks the driver to retire ([`Retire`]): the driver finishes its
//!    current step and returns its state within the bound the backend
//!    states ([`PortBackend::retire_bound`]); a driver that misses its
//!    bound is a fail-stop, and `run_port` abandons the backend and
//!    returns `None`;
//! 2. detaches the backend's interrupt entries synchronously
//!    ([`PortBackend::detach`]);
//! 3. calls [`PortBackend::uninstall`] with the held part and the driver's
//!    state by value, which returns the hardware owners by value.
//!
//! A fail-stop and a dropped owner abandon the backend and halt the driver
//! synchronously: `run_port` does not poll it again. The driver is
//! cancel-safe ([`PortBackend::drive`]).
//!
//! The host tests of this module check what types cannot: a body awaiting
//! a never-ready foreign future does not stall the driver; an uninstall
//! retires, then detaches, then uninstalls; a driver that misses its bound
//! fail-stops the port; a fail-stop and a dropped owner halt the driver at
//! its next poll.
//!
//! # Inside the backend
//!
//! One owner reaches the backend's state of the install at a time: the
//! body's task, where the joined driver and the body's parts take turns
//! through `Held`, or the backend's own interrupt context, as the interrupt
//! rule of [ownership and refusals] decides. Anything beside the body (an
//! interrupt entry, another task) reaches that state only through atomics
//! or signals; no task and no async lock is shared with it.
//!
//! - **The interrupt latches, the body's task owns:** the interrupt reads
//!   and clears its own status and posts it, and the driver serves it.
//! - **The interrupt's context owns:** terminals and receptions never
//!   depend on the driver, which runs only while the body does, so a body
//!   that ends its phase early would otherwise strand them.
//!
//! The rules of the body's task
//! ([owner decisions on #581](https://github.com/ermacv/open-esp-radio-rs/issues/581#issuecomment-6121016144)):
//!
//! - **Shared state through `with`.** Per-install state the parts and the
//!   driver share through `Held` is reached by a synchronous closure
//!   (`with`), so no borrow spans an await, and a `with` closure calls no
//!   port method: a nested borrow is a same-task reentry.
//! - **A retune stays a bounded step of `enable`**, not of the driver:
//!   `enable` takes what it needs out of `Held` and puts it back, and a
//!   driver pass meanwhile defers the work that needs it.
//! - **An interrupt-owned backend's body runs on its routes' core**, and
//!   the route binding's type states that core, so the body starts only
//!   through a spawner of that core's executor and a synchronous detach
//!   masks a handler that cannot be mid-execution. A backend whose
//!   interrupt only posts atomics needs no such binding.
//!
//! One exception is allowed: IEEE 802.15.4's interim critical section
//! between its interrupt and the phase, a short interrupt mask without an
//! await, until [#668](https://github.com/ermacv/open-esp-radio-rs/issues/668)
//! moves its engine into the interrupt's context and removes it.
//!
//! None of this reaches a caller as a refusal.
//!
//! # Compile-fail tests
//!
//! A body cannot end without an uninstall or a fail-stop:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0451
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Disabled, Ended, Owner, PortBackend, PortBody};
//! struct Forget;
//! impl<B: PortBackend> PortBody<B> for Forget {
//!     async fn run<'id>(self, owner: Owner<'_, 'id, B, Disabled>, _: B::Resources<'id>) -> Ended<'id, B> {
//!         drop(owner);
//!         Ended { uninstall: None }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Its compiling twin ends through the owner:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Disabled, Ended, Owner, PortBackend, PortBody};
//! struct FailStop;
//! impl<B: PortBackend> PortBody<B> for FailStop {
//!     async fn run<'id>(self, owner: Owner<'_, 'id, B, Disabled>, _: B::Resources<'id>) -> Ended<'id, B> {
//!         owner.fail_stop()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! No caller makes an owner outside a body:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0624
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Disabled, Owner, PortBackend};
//! fn forge<'p, 'id, B: PortBackend>(backend: B) -> Owner<'p, 'id, B, Disabled> {
//!     Owner::new(backend)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A disabled port lends no phase:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0599
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Disabled, Owner, PortBackend};
//! fn phase_while_disabled<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: &mut Owner<'_, 'id, B, Disabled>) {
//!     let _ = owner.split();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! An enabled port takes no disabled-only setting and no uninstall:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0599
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Enabled, Owner, PortBackend};
//! fn setup_while_enabled<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: &mut Owner<'_, 'id, B, Enabled>) {
//!     let _ = owner.setup();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0599
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Enabled, Owner, PortBackend};
//! fn uninstall_while_enabled<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: Owner<'_, 'id, B, Enabled>, control: B::Uninstall) {
//!     let _ = owner.uninstall(control);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! An owner is gone once its command starts, so a second command cannot
//! start beside it:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0382
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Disabled, Owner, PortBackend};
//! async fn two_commands<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: Owner<'_, 'id, B, Disabled>) {
//!     let enabling = owner.enable();
//!     let _ = owner.enable();
//!     let _ = enabling.await;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A phase's part does not outlive the phase:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0505
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Enabled, Owner, PortBackend};
//! async fn keep_the_control<'id, B: PortBackend>(mut owner: Owner<'_, 'id, B, Enabled>) {
//!     let control = owner.split().control;
//!     let _ = owner.disable(&mut |_| {}).await;
//!     drop(control);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Nor does a second phase run beside the first:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0499
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Enabled, Owner, PortBackend};
//! fn two_phases<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: &mut Owner<'_, 'id, B, Enabled>) {
//!     let first = owner.split();
//!     let second = owner.split();
//!     drop((first, second));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A caller does not reach the backend past the owner:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0616
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Enabled, Owner, PortBackend};
//! fn reach_the_backend<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: &mut Owner<'_, 'id, B, Enabled>) {
//!     let _ = &mut owner.backend;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Nor takes a part out of its loan:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0616
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Enabled, Owner, PortBackend};
//! fn take_the_part<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: &mut Owner<'_, 'id, B, Enabled>) {
//!     let _ = owner.split().control.part;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Nor does admitted work outlive the client that admitted it, so no token
//! names the work of a later phase:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0515
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{RadioPortClient, Work};
//! fn keep_the_work<C: RadioPortClient>(
//!     admit: impl for<'c> Fn(&'c C) -> Work<'c, C>,
//!     client: C,
//! ) -> Work<'static, C> {
//!     admit(&client)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Nor does a caller take the token out of a work, so a work ends only
//! through the client that admitted it:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0616
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{RadioPortClient, Work};
//! fn take_the_token<C: RadioPortClient>(work: Work<'_, C>) {
//!     let _ = work.token;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Its compiling twin reads only the work's routing key:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{RadioPortClient, Work};
//! fn read_the_key<C: RadioPortClient>(work: Work<'_, C>) {
//!     let _ = work.id();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A driver's future borrows the install, never the backend, and does not
//! outlive the install's borrow:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0700
//! # use core::future::Future;
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{PortBackend, Retire};
//! fn keep_the_driver<'p, 'id, B: PortBackend + 'static>(
//!     backend: &mut B,
//!     held: &'p B::Held<'id>,
//!     retire: Retire<'p>,
//! ) -> impl Future<Output = B::State> + 'static {
//!     backend.drive(held, retire)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Its compiling twin keeps the driver for the install's borrow only, and
//! reaches the backend beside it:
//!
//! ```
//! # use core::future::Future;
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{PortBackend, Retire};
//! fn keep_the_driver<'p, 'id, B: PortBackend + 'static>(
//!     backend: &mut B,
//!     held: &'p B::Held<'id>,
//!     retire: Retire<'p>,
//! ) -> impl Future<Output = B::State> + use<'p, 'id, B> {
//!     let driver = backend.drive(held, retire);
//!     let _ = backend.now();
//!     driver
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Only `run_port` asks a driver to retire:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0451
//! # use core::cell::Cell;
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::Retire;
//! fn forge(requested: &Cell<bool>) -> Retire<'_> {
//!     Retire { requested }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Its compiling twin reads the request it was given:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::Retire;
//! fn read(retire: &Retire<'_>) -> bool {
//!     retire.is_requested()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The compiling twin of the lifecycle tests runs a phase between the
//! commands and keeps the work only as long as its client:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Disabled, Ended, Owner, PortBackend, PortBody, RadioPortClient, Work};
//! struct OnePhase;
//! impl<B: PortBackend> PortBody<B> for OnePhase {
//!     async fn run<'id>(self, mut owner: Owner<'_, 'id, B, Disabled>, _: B::Resources<'id>) -> Ended<'id, B> {
//!         let _ = owner.setup();
//!         let mut enabled = match owner.enable().await {
//!             Ok(enabled) => enabled,
//!             Err(failed) => return failed.fail_stop(),
//!         };
//!         {
//!             let phase = enabled.split();
//!             drop(phase);
//!         }
//!         match enabled.disable(&mut |_| {}).await {
//!             Ok(disabled) => disabled.fail_stop(),
//!             Err(poisoned) => poisoned.fail_stop(),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! fn keep_the_work<'c, C: RadioPortClient>(
//!     admit: impl Fn(&'c C) -> Work<'c, C>,
//!     client: &'c C,
//! ) -> Work<'c, C> {
//!     admit(client)
//! }

//! ```
//!
//! The compiling twins of the remaining tests differ only in the rule each
//! breaks: an owner comes from `run_port`, a disabled owner uninstalls, the
//! clock is reached through the owner, and a part is borrowed through its
//! loan:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_ieee802154_port::{Disabled, Enabled, Ended, Owner, PortBackend, PortBody, run_port};
//! async fn own<B: PortBackend>(backend: B, body: impl PortBody<B>) -> Option<B::Uninstalled> {

//! }
//! fn uninstall_while_disabled<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: Owner<'_, 'id, B, Disabled>, control: B::Uninstall) {

//! }
//! fn reach_through_the_owner<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: &mut Owner<'_, 'id, B, Enabled>) {

//! }
//! fn borrow_the_part<'id, B: PortBackend>(owner: &mut Owner<'_, 'id, B, Enabled>) {
