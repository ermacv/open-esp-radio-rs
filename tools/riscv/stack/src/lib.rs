//! Worst-case stack bounds of a static RV32 image from its machine code,
//! with the companions it calls into, such as the chip's ROM ELF.
//!
//! Every function is a defined code symbol of the image. Its frame is the
//! compiler's `.stack_sizes` entry, cross-checked with the deepest entry-relative
//! `sp` the bounded value analysis of `oer-riscv-analysis` observes; a function
//! without an entry takes the observed depth only when its control-flow graph
//! is complete. Its callees are every direct call and out-of-function jump of a
//! linear sweep over its whole extent, which also reaches code behind jump
//! tables the control-flow graph does not expand, plus the transfers whose
//! target the value analysis resolves. A transfer through `table[index]`
//! reaches each entry of the table when its length is exact: a bounds check
//! or mask on the index, or the size of a data object the table starts in an
//! unwritable section, such as an interrupt handler table. The sweep already
//! covers a jump's entries inside the function; a table of unknown length
//! stays unresolved. A function's bound is its frame or, if
//! deeper, a callee's bound below the `sp` of the transfer that reaches it: the
//! value analysis's depth at that site, or the whole frame at a site it did not
//! reach. It never underestimates the code it reaches.
//!
//! Bounds fail closed: a root has a number only when nothing it reaches is
//! unresolved. Otherwise [`Bound::reasons`] counts what is, by reason, and
//! [`Reason`] names the stage that closes it.
