//! The diagnostic vendor command that armed one received-MIC corruption:
//! its opcode, its Command Complete and the corruption itself.
//!
//! Vendor-specific HCI command `0xFC01` (OGF `0x3F`, OCF `0x001`) took one
//! Connection_Handle and could be sent before encryption started. The next
//! received encrypted data PDU on that connection had one MIC octet inverted
//! before CCM authentication; plaintext PDUs carry no MIC and were left
//! alone, so the production authentication failure and connection exit ran
//! unchanged. The one-shot arming per connection, its clearing on
//! disconnection and Reset, and the choice of the Command Complete status
//! (`0x00`, `0x02` Unknown Connection Identifier, `0x0C` Command Disallowed
//! while the connection was closing, `0x12` for malformed parameters) lived
//! in the Controller core removed in #770 (tag `legacy-radio-2026-10-16`);
//! #773 brings a Controller back.
