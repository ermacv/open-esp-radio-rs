//! The station: one sans-IO machine for the whole lifecycle of an
//! infrastructure station, from its scan to its disconnect ([owner
//! decision on #563]).
//!
//! The machine takes the port's events, the channel arbiter's answers and
//! notices, its commands and time as [`StaInput`] values, and leaves what
//! the port and the arbiter must do as [`StaAction`] values, in their own
//! terms (`oer-ieee80211-lower-mac`, `oer-ieee80211-arbiter`): a thin
//! service loop feeds it and carries its actions out, and holds no logic
//! of its own:
//!
//! ```text
//! loop {
//!     select(phase.next_event(), timer(deadline), commands)
//!     station.input(now, input)
//!     while let Some(action) = station.poll_action(now) { carry it out }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Tokens
//!
//! The machine is generic over its tokens ([`StaTokens`]): the transmit
//! tickets and buffers the composition hands it at its start, minted by
//! the port, its key slots, and the arbiter's [`LeasePlace`]. A token
//! leaves in an action by value and comes back in an input, so what the
//! machine holds is what it may do, and a host test plays the port and the
//! arbiter with tokens of its own. The station encodes each frame straight
//! into the memory of its buffer token ([`TxBufferMemory`]).
//! Management requests use the configured station address as transmitter;
//! the selected BSSID identifies the receiver and the BSS.
//!
//! Station owns keys and their free slots across protocol transitions. Install
//! actions carry private affine pending tokens (key ID and link epoch for a
//! group key); responses return those tokens with the keys. A stale install
//! is removed normally. Group slots are fungible: removal returns a raw slot
//! to the free pool, whose fullness proves that every group key came back.
//!
//! # Channels
//!
//! The station never changes the port's channel: it asks the arbiter for a
//! lease of each channel it needs ([`StaAction::RequestChannel`]), listens
//! and transmits there only between the lease's start and its end, and
//! gives it back. Beside an access point, its scan goes in absences. A
//! scan the application asked for ends with a partial result after
//! [`StaConfig::skipped_absences`] consecutive cancelled leases. Among the
//! network's access points, one on the channel of the access point beside
//! the station wins within [`StaConfig::access_point_margin_db`] of the
//! strongest, so a join rarely moves that access point ([follow
//! decision]).
//!
//! A connected station's background scan visits each other channel in an
//! absence announced with a Null (PM=1), and its network's own channel
//! without one: it widens its receive rules to the other networks'
//! management frames for the dwell, then narrows them again and waits for
//! the port to confirm ([follow decision]).
//!
//! # States
//!
//! Its state is an enum whose variants hold their own types; a transition
//! takes the state by value and returns the next one, so a value of one
//! state is never read in another. Each state names the action it owes,
//! so [`Station::poll_action`] hands it out and moves to the state that
//! awaits its end: there is no queue of actions to overflow.
//!
