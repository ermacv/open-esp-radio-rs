//! Chip-neutral monotonic and radio time.
//!
//! Two time axes cross the radio contracts:
//!
//! - [`Instant`] and [`Duration`] are the image's monotonic time, the one
//!   axis every executor task waits on. A [`Clock`] reads it and a [`Timer`]
//!   waits for a deadline on it. Portable code takes both as ports; an
//!   adapter binds them to an executor's time driver and a host model binds
//!   them to virtual time.
//! - [`RadioInstant`] is a coordinate in its owner's radio domain and
//!   epoch; [`RadioDuration`] is a non-negative span within that domain.
//!   Instants of different domains cannot be compared or subtracted. The owner
//!   validates additional interface, instance or generation identity.
//!   Raw microseconds imply no image-monotonic or wall-clock relationship;
//!   the existing clock relations own conversion between domains.
//!
//! Both axes represent microseconds in `u64`. Radio spans include every
//! value from zero through `u64::MAX`; [`RadioWindow`] additionally requires
//! a non-zero span and a representable exclusive endpoint.
//! Checked arithmetic returns `None` or [`TimeOverflow`] when a result would
//! leave the representable range, and window construction returns
//! [`WindowError`]. The monotonic axis also exposes explicit saturation via
//! [`Instant::saturating_add`] for deadlines and
//! [`Instant::saturating_duration_since`]; radio arithmetic never saturates.
