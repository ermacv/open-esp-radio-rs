# ESP32-C5 HIL target

This workspace builds the esp32c5's HIL runtime, `oer-esp32c5-hil-agent`,
for `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`. The chip boots through the ESP-IDF
second-stage bootloader of [`hil/bootloaders/esp32c5`](../../bootloaders/esp32c5/),
which loads an esp-hal application linked with `linkall.x`
([chip profile](../../../platform/esp32c5/chip.toml)). The runtime runs
Embassy on the esp-rtos scheduler and time driver.

`boot-smoke` reports `OPEN_RADIO_HIL hal=INIT`
after esp-hal initialization, `OPEN_RADIO_HIL embassy=START` once the
scheduler runs, and `OPEN_RADIO_HIL boot-smoke=PASS timer=PASS` after one
timer wake, on the USB Serial/JTAG console. It does not speak the HIL wire
protocol. The runner builds it for the `boot-smoke` scenario, flashes
it with the catalog bootloader and partition table at the offsets of the chip
profile's `[flash]` table, and archives all three with the runtime ELF.
The write leaves the ROM in download mode, and an RTS reset out of it starts
the image with its USB console silent (the host reads EOF); the runner starts
it with a power-on reset instead, cycling the board's hub port and waiting
for its port to return, so the board's stand file entry needs `power` in its
`reset` ladder:

```console
cargo hil run --chip esp32c5 boot-smoke
```

`system-watchdog` serves the HIL wire protocol on the USB Serial/JTAG
console and serves `system::WatchdogTest`,
and nothing radio. Its SoC deadline watchdog is the production service of
[`oer-esp32c5-soc-esp-hal`](../../../crates/adapters/esp-hal/esp32c5/soc/)
on TIMG1's main watchdog; its boot evidence maps the chip's reset reasons
(`CoreMwdt1` is `MainWatchdog1`) and reads the reset-retained post-mortem in
RTC fast memory. The runner classifies a flashed esp32c5 image from its
image keys, and `system-watchdog` drives every watchdog mode on it:

```console
cargo hil run --chip esp32c5 system-watchdog
```

A run of either replaces the board's peer firmware; a run that needs the peer
reflashes its catalog image first.
