//! Role-neutral PAC reclaim from a finite station lifecycle phase.
//!
//! Scan and initial-join phases own `RadioRuntimeOwner` directly. Connected
//! phases own the same PAC through one cooperative register arena. This module
//! normalizes those four clean frontiers without knowing HIL, board, network
//! or executor policy. A failed arena reclaim returns the exact original
//! phase; callers may retain it for board-level fault policy and cannot
//! mistake it for stopped Wi-Fi.
