//! What a scenario run leaves for a reviewer beside its verdicts.
//!
//! The engine decides verdicts and the recorded sets of a shard; reviewer
//! aids, such as the untriaged-location report or the closure gateways, are
//! rendered by a [`RunReport`] the scenario binary passes in. Report code
//! therefore depends on the engine and never the other way, and editing it
//! leaves the evidence shards current.
