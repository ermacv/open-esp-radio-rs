//! Restricted scheduler cancellation transactions.
//!
//! The vendor cancellation paths skip listed items one at a time through the
//! skip request and, when lock/modify is enabled, bracket or follow those
//! requests with a control sequence: publish the hardware-list index,
//! acknowledge interrupt source 7, set operational control bit zero, wait for
//! two status edges and clear the control bit. The hardware effect of either
//! operation is not established, so every observation keeps its positional
//! result. Publications are finite; hardware-owned waits are split into fresh
//! observations, like the insertion commands.
