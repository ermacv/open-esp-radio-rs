//! Typed, reset-retained event trace and snapshot slots.
//!
//! A driver defines its trace points as [`Event`] types: each has a [`Kind`]
//! (a [`Domain`] plus the domain's own event id), a [`Channel`] that the host
//! enables or disables per session, and an encoding into two words. The
//! host decodes a drained [`Record`] with the same type, so no event is
//! identified by a bare number.
//!
//! The image places one [`Retained`] in memory that survives the resets it
//! cares about and builds one [`Trace`] over it:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[unsafe(link_section = ".rtc_fast.persistent")]
//! static RETAINED: oer_trace::Retained<512, 2, 1024> = oer_trace::Retained::new();
//! static TRACE: oer_trace::Trace = oer_trace::Trace::new(&RETAINED);
//!
//! let boot = oer_trace::install(&TRACE); // holds what the previous boot left
//! // ... drain `boot.previous` if it matters ...
//! oer_trace::start(default_mask);
//! ```
//!
//! Retained memory only ever sees plain loads and stores: the write index,
//! the freeze latch and the snapshot cursor are read-modify-write atomics in
//! the [`Trace`], which stays in ordinary RAM. After a reset the order of the
//! retained entries comes back from their 16-bit sequence tags, and an entry
//! a reset interrupted fails its commit word and is dropped.
//!
//! With the `record` feature disabled, [`emit`], [`freeze`] and [`capture`]
//! compile to nothing. With it, a disabled channel costs one relaxed load
//! and a branch at the call site; everything on the emit path is inlined
//! into the caller, so it runs from wherever the caller runs.
