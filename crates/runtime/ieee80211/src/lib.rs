//! Chip-independent Wi-Fi execution primitives shared by chip runtimes.
//!
//! These async ownership contracts bind no executor. Waiting on time uses
//! `oer_time::Timer`; bounded channels and task signals use `embassy-sync`.
//!
//! [`monitor`] provides bounded capture and injection handoffs. [`connected_tasks`]
//! coordinates finite task shutdown, and [`station_network`] retains network
//! ownership across station associations. [`stack_boundary`] provides an explicit
//! poll boundary for large async state machines.
//! [`station_service`] is the station's thin service on a lower-MAC port:
//! one waiting point, every machine's actions after each input. Hardware access and concrete
//! task assembly belong to the chip backend and its integration.
//!
//! The `test-support` feature exposes `lower_mac_owner`, the in-memory backend
//! and conformance harness for tests of port consumers. The module is absent
//! from production builds without that feature. The feature build includes
//! the same bounded continuous RX and terminal fault injection as unit tests.

Production code uses the station service directly:

With `test-support`, host fixtures can name the backend's capabilities:

```
use oer_ieee80211_runtime::lower_mac_owner::model::ModelCaps;
