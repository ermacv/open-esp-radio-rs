# Hardware errata

Hardware and ROM behaviour that the stand's boards show and that the chip
documentation does not describe. Each entry names the affected chip and
revision, how the fault shows, the exact condition that triggers it, how it
was established and what the repository does about it. A workaround stays
with its owner; this page is the canonical description the owners link to.

## ESP32-C5 rev 1.0: a USB Serial/JTAG reset boots into UART/SDIO download

**Chip:** ESP32-C5 revision v1.0 (ROM `esp32c5-eco2-20250121`), observed on
the stand's `esp32c5` board.

**Symptom.** A reset requested over the chip's USB Serial/JTAG port (the
host pulses the virtual RTS line, as `espflash`, `esptool` and the stand's
flash commands do) restarts the chip into ROM download mode through UART0 or
SDIO instead of booting from flash:

```text
rst:0x15 (USB_UART_HPSYS),boot:0x0 (DOWNLOAD(UART0/SDIO_FEI_FEO))
wait uart0/sdio download
```

In that mode the ROM does not serve USB Serial/JTAG: CDC control requests
fail with a STALL (`EPIPE` on the host), `espflash` and OpenOCD cannot connect,
and a USB port reset drops the device from the bus (`error -71`). Only the
board's RST button, which resets the whole chip, recovers it. A normal boot
reads `boot:0x18` or `boot:0x58` (SPI fast flash boot), and a download
request over USB reads `boot:0x8`.

**Trigger.** The field `clk_i2c_mst_st_map` of `MODEM_LPCON`
`CLK_CONF_POWER_ST` selects the PMU power states in which the clock of the
analog register I2C master runs, one bit per state: SLEEP, MODEM, ACTIVE.
The ROM and applications that leave the field alone have ACTIVE only. ESP-IDF's
modem clock initialisation (`components/esp_hw_support/modem/port/esp32c5/modem_clock_impl.c`,
the `MODEM_CLOCK_DOMAIN_I2C_MASTER` default) sets ACTIVE and MODEM in every
application, whether or not it uses the radio. The register belongs to the LP
domain and keeps its value through the HP-system reset that a USB
Serial/JTAG RTS pulse performs; with the MODEM bit still set, the ROM of this
revision takes the UART/SDIO download path. Why the ROM does so is not
documented; the condition is established by experiment. The neighbouring
`clk_lp_apb_st_map`, which ESP-IDF also widens to ACTIVE and MODEM, has no
effect.

This is a different fault from the ESP-IDF USB Serial/JTAG console fix for the
same revision that keeps UART0's clock enabled (`IDFGH-17050`); ESP-IDF
master `4d59230d` and release v6.1 both contain that fix and both show this
fault.

**How it was established.**

- Every ESP-IDF image hung on a USB reset (the IEEE 802.15.4 and OpenThread
  peers on ESP-IDF master `4d59230d` and on v6.1, with the radio enabled or
  disabled), while esp-hal images booted normally after the same reset.
- The LP-domain registers of a running esp-hal image and a running ESP-IDF
  image, read over the chip's JTAG with OpenOCD, differ in PMU state
  configuration, `LP_ANA` brown-out control, `LPPERI` clock enables and
  `MODEM_LPCON` `CLK_CONF_POWER_ST`.
- Writing the esp-hal values into the running ESP-IDF image before the USB
  reset, group by group, isolated the fault: restoring `clk_i2c_mst_st_map`
  alone to ACTIVE made the ESP-IDF image boot normally after the reset;
  restoring every other differing register left it hanging.
- A reset through the chip's JTAG (OpenOCD `reset run`, cause
  `JTAG CPU reset`) is not affected.

**Workaround.**

- An application that never enters the PMU MODEM state (no power management,
  no light sleep with the modem on) restores ACTIVE only in
  `clk_i2c_mst_st_map` at start and after each radio enable. The stand's
  ESP-IDF peers do so; see
  [the IEEE 802.15.4 peer](../hil/peers/esp32c5-ieee802154/README.md#usb-serialjtag-resets).
  With it, USB resets and flashing over a running peer work.
- Firmware for the ESP32-C5 in this repository must not add the MODEM state
  to that map unless it also avoids USB Serial/JTAG resets. The
  [ESP32-C5 register model](../registers/esp32c5/README.md) publishes the
  field with this constraint and the observation as its evidence.
- Any other ESP-IDF image on an ESP32-C5 rev 1.0, such as a vendor comparison
  image without the workaround, is reset or flashed through JTAG
  (`cargo hil flash --via jtag`, `cargo hil firmware flash --jtag`), not over
  USB Serial/JTAG.

**Limits.** Observed on one board of revision v1.0. Other revisions and
boards are unverified.
