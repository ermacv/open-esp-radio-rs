//! connection created and closes it as "Connection Failed to be Established"
//! (0x3E), while the DUT never saw it. A central retries such a connection;
//! the fixture does the same, but only when the DUT's own observation proves
//! the connection never reached it, and it records every attempt so the loss
//! stays visible as a measurement. The host's connect alone proves nothing:
//! the kernel may report the socket connected before the first procedure, so
//! an attempt succeeds only once the DUT confirms the connection
//! ([`CONFIRMATION`]).
