//! The one reader of a run bundle.
//!
//! [`RunBundle::open`] reads a run's manifest into its typed form; every
//! other document of the bundle is read through it, typed: the plan, the
//! suite and its scenario and repetition results with their measurements,
//! the scenario snapshots, the cleanup and USB records of a repetition, the
//! laboratory and build provenance, the event stream, the integrity seal and
//! the scenario seals. A document outside this build's vocabulary is an
//! error, never a silently absent value. Whoever reads a bundle, the `cargo
//! hil` analyses or the qualification evaluator, reads it here; the
//! evaluator's independence comes from verifying the seals and hashing every
//! file again when it admits a run ([`RunBundle::integrity`],
//! [`RunBundle::attempts`]), not from a second reader.
