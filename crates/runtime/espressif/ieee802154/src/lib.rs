//! Executor-independent IEEE 802.15.4 radio runtime for the ESP32-S31.
//!
//! [`Ieee802154Runtime`] holds the radio role — the ported ESP-IDF MAC
//! engine behind the portable radio contract — together with the MAC owners
//! in one blocking mutex over a caller-chosen raw mutex, as the vendor driver
//! holds its state under `ieee802154_enter_critical`. The platform interrupt
//! handler and every command run inside that lock. Portable events leave the
//! lock as owned values through a bounded queue that any executor may await.
//! [`Ieee802154Runtime::install`] returns the installed radio as the IEEE
//! 802.15.4 port's backend ([`Ieee802154RuntimeBackend`], the owner shape of
//! `oer_ieee802154::owner`), which the composition hands to `run_port`; the
//! port's end masks the MAC route and returns the engine and the hardware.
//! The engine stays behind the runtime's blocking mutex, shared with the
//! MAC interrupt, an interim the owner allowed until #668.
//!
//! CSMA-CA backoffs and the delays before retries run on the runtime's
//! [`oer_time::Timer`] in the port's joined driver, as ESP-IDF's OpenThread
//! `SubMac` runs them on its tasklet timer; the events consumer only takes
//! events.
//!
//! The bounded event queue keeps a slot free for the next operation's
//! terminal, which the operation permit admits, and for the fault that may
//! end an enabled period: a terminal event is never lost. Only received
//! frames are dropped when the queue is full, reported as [`EventsLost`] in
//! place of the first dropped frame.
//!
//! A radio fault poisons the port: the events consumer hands out the
//! failed operation's terminal and the events before it, then `Poisoned`
//! at every later call.
//!
//! Shared-PHY tracking runs with the MAC receiving, as ESP-IDF's
//! `phy_common.c` does: the runtime never pauses for it, and an operation
//! that loses RF ends with its ordinary terminal event.
//!
//! Abandonment publishes permanent logical poisoning atomically. It never
//! enters the mutex that contains the ISR and returns `Unconfirmed`: neither
//! hardware stopping nor IRQ exclusion is proved. The installation and its
//! backing remain quarantined until chip reset. `Uninstalled::Reusable`
//! returns ordinary teardown's owners; `Uninstalled::Quarantined` retains
//! the poisoned runtime without taking its lock or touching hardware.
//! A disable sink can return a terminal with `ControlFlow::Break`. The
//! runtime then stops delivery, publishes `StateLost`, and retains that
//! terminal and the remaining queue. Uninstall returns `Quarantined` and
//! preserves all installation owners until chip reset.
