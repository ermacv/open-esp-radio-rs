# Register binding index

`oer-register-bindings` is the format of a publication's binding index,
`registers/<chip>/published/*.bindings.toml`: every register address with its
fields and, when the publication generates a PAC, the PAC path that reaches it.
`cargo registers generate` writes it; tools that name addresses and bits, such
as vendor scenarios and the stand's reset-cause read, read it through
`BindingIndex` instead of declaring its shape again. It is a foundation data
format, so every host layer may read it.
