//! Software-coexistence priorities of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC.
//!
//! In a build with software coexistence the pinned driver publishes the MAC's
//! two PTI fields through libcoexist: `ieee802154_mac_init` sets the ACK PTI
//! to the middle level and the TX/RX PTI to the idle scene, and each
//! operation start switches the TX/RX PTI to its scene
//! (`ieee802154_set_txrx_pti` of `esp_ieee802154_util.c`). Each chip resolves
//! the priority of a level from its own coexistence table. A build without
//! software coexistence disables both fields instead
//! (`ieee802154_ll_disable_coex`).

/// One four-bit coexistence priority, the shared-table domain every
