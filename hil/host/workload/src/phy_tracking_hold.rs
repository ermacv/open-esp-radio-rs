//! The RF hold of one shared-PHY tracking tick, timed on the device
//! (`phy/tracking/hold/measure`, #591).
//!
//! A workload of another family calls this while its own clients use the
//! radio. [`suspend`] stops the device's periodic tracking timer, so the
//! timed ticks are the only tracking. [`measure`] forces each
//! [`CONFIGURATIONS`] branch set with a zero threshold and times
//! `ticks` due ticks of it, under the workload's [`Load`]. [`record`] writes
//! the samples as the `phy-tracking-hold` observation and refuses a failed,
//! skipped or malformed tick. [`resume`] restarts the timer.
//!
//! A grant-protect interval is the time the PHY's coexistence request was
//! programmed, not a proof that the arbiter kept every other radio off the
//! air.
