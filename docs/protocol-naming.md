# Radio protocol terminology

This reference defines technical names and namespace conventions. The
[driver architecture](../driver/README.md) defines concrete code owners.

## Protocol families

Use `ieee80211`, `ieee802154` and `bluetooth` for internal protocol families
at the portable, chip and adapter levels. A family namespace may contain an
explicit extension, local policy or silicon backend. It does not claim a
complete standard implementation or certification.

| Term | Meaning | Repository convention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IEEE 802.11 | WLAN MAC and PHY specification family | `ieee80211` for internal protocol implementation |
| WLAN | Wireless local area network | A network/interface category, not an additional driver layer |
| Wi-Fi | Technology and ecosystem based on IEEE 802.11 | `wifi` is appropriate for user-facing APIs; it does not imply Wi-Fi certification |
| IEEE 802.15.4 | MAC/PHY family for low-rate wireless networks | `ieee802154`; each implementation states its PHY/channel/frame limits |
| WPAN | Wireless personal area network | A broader category, not a replacement name for the 802.15.4 backend |
| Bluetooth | Bluetooth SIG family, including BR/EDR and LE | `bluetooth`, with implemented LE procedures under `le` |
| HCI | Host–Controller commands, events and data transport | `bluetooth/hci`; neither an on-air protocol nor a complete Host stack |
| LE Link Layer | LE on-air PDUs and Link Layer procedures | `bluetooth/le/ll` |

IEEE 802.15.4 does not itself provide Thread or Zigbee. HCI also applies to
BR/EDR and must not be named as if it were exclusively LE Link Layer.
`legacy advertising` in this code means legacy LE advertising.

The conventions follow the scope described by [IEEE 802.11](https://www.ieee802.org/11/abt80211.html),
[IEEE 802.15.4](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.15.4/11041/),
[Wi-Fi technology terminology](https://standards.ieee.org/beyond-standards/the-evolution-of-wi-fi-technology-and-standards/)
and the [Bluetooth architecture](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Files/Specification/HTML/Core-62/out/en/architecture%2C-change-history%2C-and-conventions/architecture.html).

## Responsibility matters more than symmetry

| Boundary | Owns | Does not imply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frame/wire/IE codecs | Packet representation, parsing and encoding | Radio or key ownership |
| Protocol/MAC/LL state | Windows, peers, retries and security transitions | MMIO, executor or hardware offload |
| Interface/contract | Values and capabilities exchanged by owners | A hidden peer/key store |
| Chip backend | Descriptors, timed execution, hardware MAC/LL and interrupt semantics | A complete upper stack |
| Adapter | Binding an existing capability to an external library, timer or CPU route | Another independent hardware owner |
| Integration | Resource selection, placement and final composition | Copied production algorithms |

Portable MAC mechanisms and a chip's hardware MAC backend may both use
`mac` within their different parents. Bluetooth retains `ll` for Link Layer.
Consistent ownership does not require identical protocol subdirectories,
shared frame types, IRQ queues or separate crates at every level.

`softmac` describes the division of MAC work between software and hardware;
it does not mean that all offloads are absent. The repository's
`MacOperationOwnership` is the per-operation contract. Similar names in
[Linux mac80211](https://wireless.docs.kernel.org/en/latest/en/developers/documentation/mac80211.html)
do not establish the same ownership here.

## Module and API names

Use path context instead of repeating a chip/protocol prefix on every private
type. For example, chip Bluetooth procedures live under
`le/{dtm,advertising,scanning,peripheral}`; their shared controller, IRQ and
scheduler remain outside those procedure modules. Each procedure retains its
own lifecycle owner.

Encoding a frame does not authorize installing a key or publishing DMA work.
WPA2 secrets and zeroization remain with their state owner; association
capability encoders stay beside the association encoder that uses them.
Chip AP profile selection is separate from portable advertisement encoding.

Public exports may retain chip/protocol prefixes to distinguish backends.
Reexports expose an API without creating another owner. Application code can
use `use open_esp_radio as oer;` and context-specific local names such as
`RadioSystem` or `NetworkRunner`. Keep meaningful lifecycle names such as
`Prepared`, `Running` and `Quarantined`, including precise failure owners.

Vendor/upstream register names, SVD identifiers and Cargo package identities
retain their provenance. Namespace consistency does not require renaming
every package or creating folders for unimplemented protocol stacks.
