//! The CCMP replay check of one association's keys, shared by the station
//! and the access point: the receive frontiers of the pairwise key and of
//! each installed group key by its index, each with one lane for non-QoS
//! frames and one per TID ([`CcmpRxReplayState`]). A group key's frontiers
//! start from its receive sequence when it is installed and leave with its
//! removal, so the old and the new key of a rekey are both checked while
//! both are installed.
//!
//! The receive path checks a frame here once it is decrypted and verified,
//! and after the reorder of its TID, when the receiver has one: within a
//! lane the packet numbers then strictly increase. Moved from the ESP32-S31
//! station's connected receive path ([layering decision on #563]).
