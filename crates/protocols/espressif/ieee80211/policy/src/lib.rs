//! Espressif IEEE 802.11 transmit policy data.
//!
//! The portable algorithms above the lower-MAC port
//! (`oer-ieee80211-upper-mac`, `oer-ieee80211-mac`) take their limits, rate
//! ladders and estimates as parameters. This package holds the values the
//! Espressif stack uses, recovered from the pinned vendor libraries with
//! their provenance, for every chip of the family that runs that policy:
//!
//! - [`rate_schedule`]: the `libpp.a` rate-schedule arenas, their record
//!   walk and the rate-to-record maps;
//! - [`rate_code`]: the `wifi_phy_rate_t` codes of those records as portable
//!   rates;
//! - [`retry_ladder`]: the ordinary-MPDU retry ladder over the schedules,
//!   as a portable `RateLadder`;
//! - [`lmac`]: retry limits, A-MPDU lifetime and aging, the RTS threshold
//!   and the default EDCA contention;
//! - [`he_txop`]: the HE TXOP duration byte budget, as a portable
//!   `HeTxopRtsBudget`;
//! - [`ccmp`]: the transmit packet-number step.
//!
//! Where an algorithm is inseparable from the vendor bytes it walks (the
//! schedule walk and the retry ladder), it lives here beside them.
