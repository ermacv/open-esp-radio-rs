//! The runtime on the IEEE 802.15.4 owner shape ([`oer_ieee802154::owner`]):
//! [`Ieee802154RuntimeBackend`] is the `PortBackend` a composition hands to
//! [`run_port`](oer_radio_port::run_port).
//!
//! The engine stays in the runtime's blocking mutex, shared with the MAC
//! interrupt entry: an interim critical section the owner allowed until
//! #668 moves the engine into the interrupt context. The joined driver
//! ([`PortBackend::drive`]) runs the CSMA-CA backoff and the retry delays
//! that the runner beside the consumer ran before.
//!
//! - The one operation permit lives in the held part of the install
//!   ([`RuntimeHeld`]): a client awaits it on its interface's seat, a
//!   submission moves it in, and the events consumer gives it back when it
//!   takes the operation's terminal, before it hands the event out.
//! - Receive and sleep are per-interface wishes, also in the held part. The
//!   radio receives on the one channel every receiving interface shares;
//!   a receive on another channel waits until those interfaces sleep. A
//!   wish made while an operation runs takes effect when it ends.
//! - A scheduled receive window is a wish too. It takes the radio's resting
//!   state on its channel and owes no event; the runtime marks the window
//!   ended when the engine reports it, and returns to the receive union.
//! - A radio fault poisons the port: the consumer reports the events before
//!   it, then `Poisoned` at every call.
//!
//! The engine's pending table keeps one entry per address. A slot of the
//! owner shape stands for one entry; adding an address twice through two
//! slots keeps one entry, which the first removal clears.
