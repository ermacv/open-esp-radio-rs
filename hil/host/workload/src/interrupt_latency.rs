//! The latency of a software interrupt raised at the radio interrupts'
//! level, timed on the device (`system/interrupt-latency/measure`, #643).
//!
//! A workload calls [`measure`] while its traffic runs, spreading the
//! samples over its traffic window after a lead for the traffic to start,
//! and again once it ended. [`record`] writes both as the `interrupt-latency` observation, in
//! nanoseconds as well as cycles, and refuses a missed sample.
