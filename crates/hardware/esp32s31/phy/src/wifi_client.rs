//! Wi-Fi as a client of the shared PHY domain.
//!
//! The HAL chain holds the Wi-Fi partition; the registered PHY domain lives
//! under the arbiter as [`ConcurrentPhy`]. After its module clocks, ESP-IDF's
//! Wi-Fi start runs `esp_phy_enable(PHY_MODEM_WIFI)`. [`join_wifi`] records
//! that on the [`WifiClocked`] owner and issues the affine
//! [`WifiPhyMembership`]; [`leave_wifi`] consumes it again. While it holds
//! the membership, Wi-Fi switches its baseband receive path with
//! [`set_wifi_rx`], the vendor `phy_wifi_enable_set`. Modem sleep trades the
//! membership for a [`WifiPhySuspended`] token ([`suspend_wifi`], the vendor
//! `wifi_rf_phy_disable`) and back ([`resume_wifi`], `wifi_rf_phy_enable`).
//! Wi-Fi uses no BTBB baseband.
