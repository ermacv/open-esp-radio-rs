//! The station's power-management state as its access point sees it: the
//! first decision of `modem_sleep`'s portable decision half ([owner
//! decision on #563]), which its split takes over without a second copy.
//!
//! A station tells its access point whether it sleeps with the PM bit of a
//! Null. A Null's retries are its retry plan in the driver
//! ([`NULL_TRANSMISSIONS`]); one the plan could not deliver leaves the two
//! sides apart. The decision here closes the gap the one way the station
//! can observe it: awake, it sent PM=0 that never arrived, so the access
//! point may still buffer its frames, and a beacon whose TIM shows the
//! station's association identifier says it does: the station sends PM=0
//! again. The beacon is read with
//! [`parse_sta_beacon`](oer_ieee80211_mac::station_beacon::parse_sta_beacon).
//!
