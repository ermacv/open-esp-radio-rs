//! The HIL run bundle's writer, store and verification; its format and
//! reader are `oer-hil-run-bundle-format`.
//!
//! - [`run`]: the writer [`run::RunSession`] that creates, seals and
//!   interrupts a run;
//! - [`store`]: [`store::RunStore`], the run store every checkout shares, its
//!   sidecars (pins, quarantine, performance baselines, caches) and a
//!   checkout's pending evidence.
//! - [`receipt`]: the receipt a runner process names its runs in.
//! - [`build`]: the content-addressed object store and source capture of a
//!   run's images; the image builder fills their provenance.
//! - [`verify`]: the offline verification of a whole bundle, its build
//!   records and its replays against the image builder's recipe.
