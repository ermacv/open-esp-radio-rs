//! Scheduler-free Embassy platform runtime for Espressif staged-boot
//! applications; a chip feature selects the chip of esp-hal.
//!
//! This crate owns only executor wake-up and timer-queue integration. It does
//! not own radio policy, board electrical parameters, credentials, sockets,
//! HIL protocol. Optional timer observations describe only its own execution. Applications supply the ESP-HAL software
//! interrupt and timer capabilities explicitly, with the tokens of their
//! sources in the image's interrupt table, whose entries name
//! `wake_handler` and `timer_interrupt`.
