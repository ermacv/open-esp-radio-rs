//! Retry of an A-MPDU from its BlockAck.
//!
//! A backend without `HardwareServices::AMPDU_RETRY_SELECTION` reports the
//! recipient's BlockAck ([`BlockAckReport`]) and leaves the choice of what to
//! send next to the caller. [`AmpduRetryState`] makes that choice for one
//! aggregate: after each attempt it keeps the unacknowledged subframes, in
//! their original order, for another aggregate with their Retry bit set,
//! republishes the unchanged aggregate after a failed protection exchange,
//! hands the missing subframes over to individual transmission when the
//! Block Ack agreement ended or one subframe remains, or ends the exchange
//! when every subframe is acknowledged, a retry limit is reached or the MSDU
//! lifetime has run out.
//!
//! Subframes are named by their position in the first aggregate (bit `i`
//! of a mask is subframe `i`); a retry compacts the aggregate to the
//! selected subframes, so the helpers here ([`unacknowledged`],
//! [`compact`], [`set_retry_bit`]) work on those masks and on the encoded
//! MPDUs.
