# Espressif staged-boot layout

`oer-espressif-staged-layout` is the chip-neutral contract of the staged
boot: the `Layout` type each chip's platform (`platform/<chip>/layout`)
states its address map with, the stage-two image header and checksum, the
input sections the boot zeroes, and the linker binding. It is a `no_std`
library without hardware access, shared by the bootstrap, the stage-two
runtime, the chip layouts and the build scripts of every staged image.

| Module | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `memory` | `Region` and `Layout`: SRAM, Flash XIP, PSRAM and retained regions, the second-stage loader bound, the bootstrap PSRAM probe page, the stage-two PSRAM window, stack sizes, hart count and the chip's ROM script |
| `interrupts` | The chip-neutral interrupt contract: table and vector symbols, entry layout, interrupt-stack guard |
| `stage_two` | The little-endian image `Header`, its magic, ABI version and size, and the payload CRC-32 with the checksum field read as zero |
| `zeroed` | The input sections the runtime linker script places in regions the boot zeroes |
| `build` (feature `build`) | `configure_runtime` and `configure_bootstrap`, which link a binary with the shared scripts under [`linker`](../linker) and the chip's ROM script, define every layout value as a `--defsym` symbol and keep the link's relocations (`--emit-relocs`) for the stack analysis |

The linker scripts contain no addresses or header constants of their own;
they read `SRAM_ORIGIN`, `RUNTIME_PSRAM_ORIGIN`, `HART_COUNT`,
`STAGE_TWO_MAGIC` and the other symbols emitted by `build`. Stage two has
one placement: code, data and task stacks in PSRAM; interrupt entries,
per-hart interrupt stacks, hot code, critical state and DMA state in
internal SRAM. The shared panic handler and compiler panic entry helpers
also stay in SRAM, since an exception or interrupt may reach them with
caches unavailable. HAL owns the register-only reset preparation for each
chip; it must not reacquire locks held by the failing context.

## Layout seed

Code that runs from cached external memory is sensitive to where the linker
happens to place each function: an unrelated dependency change can re-sort
them and move a throughput figure by tens of percent. Setting
`OER_LAYOUT_SEED` to a nonzero decimal `u32` while building a runtime image
makes the linker shuffle the ordinary `.text.*` and `.rodata.*` input sections
with that seed. The same seed reproduces the same image; only the binary is
relinked. The entry, trap and instruction-stream sections and the explicitly
placed ISR, hot and critical sections keep their placement. Zero is rejected,
because the linker would read it as a random seed that no build record could
reproduce.
