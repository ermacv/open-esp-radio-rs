# Blobray Next: in-process operations over captured executables

`blobray-next` is the Blobray host: the `blobray` CLI, the JSON wire types in
`blobray_next_host::wire` and the Linux linker adapters. Every operation runs
in the calling process over executables given as bytes and identified by
content: inventory, whole-library analysis and register accesses, synthetic
linking with explicit ROM companions, exact data export, final-image target
audits and in-process execution and comparison. Nothing is imported, stored or
published. `cargo blobray` selects this host.
The [architecture](../docs/design/architecture.md) owns module authority;
[contracts](../docs/design/contracts.md) owns identities, assessment and
resource rules; [workflows](../docs/design/workflows.md) lists the supported
scenarios. This page indexes the current references.

An operation's success is separate from its research coverage and from any
comparison verdict: a returned result can describe partial research or a
`DIFF`/`INCOMPLETE` comparison. See [result assessment](../docs/design/contracts.md#result-assessment).
Unsupported ISA semantics remain explicit gaps. There is no general
equivalence proof, TUI or allocation-free core.

## Reference navigation

Choose a question in the [task map](../README.md#choose-a-task), then use the
relevant reference. CLI syntax is also available through `cargo blobray --help`
and each command's `--help`.

`blobray __command-tree` prints every visible command with its long flags as
JSON, tracked in [`command-tree.json`](command-tree.json) so documentation
checks need not build Blobray. `cargo test -p blobray-next` fails when the
tracked tree differs from the command line; run it with
`BLOBRAY_COMMAND_TREE_UPDATE=1` to rewrite the file.
