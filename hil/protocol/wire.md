# HIL wire contract

Host and firmware must use the same wire version, defined by
[`PROTOCOL_VERSION`](src/message.rs). Other versions are rejected before
interpreting their command and evidence layouts. Capabilities describe which
operations the selected image implements; they do not replace wire-version
validation.

## Framing

Source types are authoritative. A frame is:

```text
00 00 | COBS(fixed-header | postcard(body) | CRC32C) | 00
```

The 34-byte little-endian header contains magic `ORHL`, framing version,
command/event kind, protocol version, boot ID, message sequence, session ID,
request ID and payload length. CRC covers header and body. A wrong kind or
version is rejected before postcard decoding. Host and target treat decode
errors, sequence gaps and bounded-queue loss as protocol failure.

The optional `async-io` feature exposes `write_frame` for an already encoded
frame. It writes all bytes and flushes before returning success. Callers must
bound the complete operation, including flush: accepting bytes alone does not
complete a USB transfer whose final packet is full.

## Discovery and boot identity

Read-only attachment discovers a running runtime with `GetCapabilities` in an
envelope whose boot ID and session ID are zero. The reply is a correlated
`Hello` carrying the current nonzero boot ID; all subsequent queries bind to
that boot. This exception admits no other command, and protocol-version checks
still apply. Older firmware that rejects discovery must be explicitly updated;
the host never resets it to obtain status. An attachment begins at the current
event sequence; a reset-driven qualification capture still requires the boot
`Hello` at sequence zero. Both modes reject later sequence gaps and reboot.

`GetStatus`, `QueryStackUsage` and `QueryLinkHealth` do not initialize the runtime
or consume retained results. Stack queries can return `InvalidState` while
initialization is pending or session ownership prevents a safe snapshot. A
status observation preserves this unavailability and cumulative link counters
instead of applying a new workload's acceptance criteria to previous activity.
