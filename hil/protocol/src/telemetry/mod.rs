//! The telemetry module: the program-counter profile. No current image
//! produces it; the shared scenario `[profile]` header still names it, and
//! #761 decides both. The event trace went with the images that served it in
//! #770 (tag `legacy-radio-2026-10-16`). The Wi-Fi observer properties have
//! had no producer since the Wi-Fi stack went in #762 (tag
//! `legacy-wifi-2026-10-16`); #770 deleted their definitions.
