//! The ESP32-S31 Wi-Fi backend on the owner shape of the lower-MAC port
//! (`oer_ieee80211_lower_mac::owner`, `oer-ieee80211-port`).
//!
//! [`Esp32s31LowerMac`] is the runtime a composition places in a `static`:
//! the sans-IO [`LowerMacCore`] of `oer-esp32s31-ieee80211` and its register
//! owner in one blocking mutex over a caller-chosen raw mutex, the event
//! queues, and the entries the interrupts and the receive producer call
//! ([`Esp32s31LowerMac::on_interrupt`], [`Esp32s31LowerMac::on_power_interrupt`],
//! [`Esp32s31LowerMac::on_received`]). Those entries only post: they run
//! the core's service under the lock and queue its events.
//!
//! [`Esp32s31LowerMac::install`] installs a disabled core with its register
//! owner, its retune and the install's access-point address, and returns
//! the [`Esp32s31Backend`], which the composition hands to
//! [`run_port`](oer_ieee80211_port::run_port) with the port's body. The
//! backend is direct ([`PortBackend::Held`]): its held part keeps the
//! transmit permits ([`TxPermits`]) and the receive Block Ack agreements,
//! the parts reach the core synchronously, and its driver
//! ([`PortBackend::drive`]) serves what the core runs in software: the
//! publication watchdog of the attempts in flight, the interrupt causes
//! deferred while a retune held the registers, and the permits of every
//! attempt whose completion the core reported, which it gives back before
//! the event consumer hands the completion out.
//!
//! `Enable` is one bounded step of the owner: it enables the core and, when
//! the core asks for it after a channel change, retunes the PHY through the
//! [`LowerMacRetune`] it holds, under the shared radio's lease
//! ([`Esp32s31PortRetune`]). A refused retune leaves the port disabled
//! ([`RetuneRefused`]). The core's lifecycle terminals reach the owner's
//! transitions, never the event consumer.
//!
//! Each of the four ordinary EDCA queues holds one attempt, which the
//! queue permit of [`TxPermits`] proves; completions leave in whatever
//! order the queues end, correlated by `TxId`. Received frames hold their
//! receive unit (on the target, a staging-pool DMA buffer) until the
//! consumer drops it. A fault poisons the port: the queued events are still
//! reported, then [`Poisoned`] with the [`LowerMacFault`] at every call.
//!
//! The receive Block Ack slots are one pool both roles share, as the
//! hardware's banks are (owner decision, Claude Code chat with common,
//! 2026-10-12).
//!
//! This backend has no A-MPDU, beacon-timing or monitor operation: the
//! owner-shape contract has none yet, and the product datapath keeps its
//! direct path until it moves onto the port (#709 step 2).
