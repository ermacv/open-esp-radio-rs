//! One registered PHY domain shared by concurrently running protocol clients.
//!
//! [`ConcurrentPhy`] is the PHY layer's attachment to the HAL shared radio
//! arbiter (`SharedRadio<ConcurrentPhy>`). Every operation takes the arbiter's
//! lease, so access to the domain is serialized by the same mechanism that
//! serializes the shared registers, and PHY work always runs on the lease's
//! shared-PHY borrow.
//!
//! The domain is registered once. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15.4 enter and
//! leave it as clients of the one client set. Scheduled tracking and a first
//! acquisition that needs tracking leave the domain *pending* until the
//! tracking transaction runs. A failed or cancelled tracking transaction
//! poisons the domain until reset.
//!
//! Pending tracking starts as ESP-IDF's does: `phy_param_track_tot` runs
//! from a periodic timer under the PHY lock alone, without pausing any
//! protocol, and its RF-sensitive regions carry the grant-protect request.
//! Here the arbiter lease is that lock and the tracking graph emits the grant
//! brackets; a protocol operation that loses RF to it ends with its ordinary
//! outcome.
//!
//! The domain also owns its modem clock modules, as ESP-IDF's `esp_phy_enable`
//! and `esp_phy_disable` do: `PHY` is held while RF is open, and
//! `PHY_CALIBRATION` only while registration or RF wake runs. After the last
//! client leaves, closing RF releases `PHY`; waking RF takes it again.
