//! The transmit planner: one frame exchange as a sequence of lower-MAC
//! attempts.
//!
//! A lower-MAC attempt is one hardware transmission. [`TxPlanner`] turns an
//! outbound MPDU or A-MPDU into those attempts. [`TxPlanner::begin`] returns
//! the exchange's state ([`TxExchange`]) and its first [`TxAttemptPlan`]: the
//! rate the peer's [`RateLadder`] gives, the protection exchange the
//! [`ProtectionPolicy`] selects, the backoff the access category's
//! [`EdcaContention`] draws from the caller's entropy, and which frame
//! content with which Retry bits the attempt carries. [`TxPlanner::complete`]
//! takes that attempt's [`PublicationReport`] and returns either the next plan or
//! the exchange's [`TxReport`]:
//!
//! - an MPDU follows [`MpduRetryState`]: retried at the ladder's next rate
//!   until delivered or a retry limit is reached;
//! - an A-MPDU follows [`AmpduRetryState`]: retransmitted as an aggregate of
//!   the unacknowledged subframes, republished unchanged after a failed
//!   protection exchange, asked for its BlockAck with a BlockAckReq, and
//!   finished or handed over to individual transmission of its missing
//!   subframes, each again an MPDU exchange.
//!
//! The planner never holds frame bytes and never waits: the caller encodes
//! each attempt from its own copy of the frames, submits it and feeds the
//! completion back. A retransmission carries the bytes first encoded, so
//! its sequence number and CCMP packet number repeat.
