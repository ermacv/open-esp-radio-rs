//! Bounded AP beacon storage and executor-time TSF publication.
//!
//! The beacon is a template the access point prepares for publication:
//! the TSF (its own time since its TSF restarted), the management sequence,
//! the TIM and the DTIM count. Its schedule is an absolute TBTT cursor that a
//! late publication does not move.
//! Preparation stamps the supplied executor time; a software TX queue can
//! delay hardware submission and on-air transmission.
//!
//! A move of the BSS to another channel is announced in the template: the
//! Channel Switch Announcement (and, for a 40 MHz channel, the Secondary
//! Channel Offset) follows the TIM, and each publication writes the beacons
//! left until the switch. After the beacon that counts one the switch is
//! due at the next TBTT; the access point's owner moves the port and the
//! template is written again for the new channel ([`ApBeacon::rewrite`]).
