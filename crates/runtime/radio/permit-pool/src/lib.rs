//! An allocation-free, first-in, first-out pool of a radio port install's
//! permits ([`oer_radio_port::PermitPool`]).
//!
//! A backend keeps a [`FifoPermitPool`] in its held part of the install
//! (`PortBackend::Held`) and fills it with permits its `resources` mint
//! ([`Permits`](oer_radio_port::Permits)), so every permit in
//! it is real capacity of that install. Its line holds a place for each
//! seat of its kind: the backend mints them with the pool's [`Line`]
//! ([`Permits`](oer_radio_port::Permits)) and hands each taker its
//! seat. Takers wait in arrival order, never refused:
//!
//! - a taker takes its seat's place in the line at its first poll, and is
//!   served once it leads the line and a permit is free;
//! - a released permit wakes the leader; a served taker that leaves a
//!   permit free wakes the next leader, so two releases before any taker
//!   runs serve two takers;
//! - a taker whose future drops gives up its place, and the taker behind it
//!   leads; its seat stays with it.
//!
//! The line has a place for every seat, so it is never full and arrival
//! order holds for every taker. Every component retains its sealed layout path. Even two pools of the
//! same kind have different permit and seat types; a foreign seat cannot
//! index this line. Separate permit pools may intentionally use the same
//! waiter domain by consuming their supplies with the same copyable Line.
//!
//! The pool is `!Sync`: it lives in one task, the port body's, and is
//! shared there by reference between the body's parts. Nothing outside the
//! task reaches it.
//!
//! No caller makes a permit, so no caller adds capacity:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0451
//! # use oer_radio_port::Permit;
//! fn forge<'id, K>() -> Permit<'id, K> {
//!     Permit { index: 0, brand: core::marker::PhantomData, kind: core::marker::PhantomData }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A pool of one install does not take another's permits, and its line
//! holds a place for exactly the seats minted with it:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use oer_radio_permit_pool::FifoPermitPool;
//! # use oer_radio_port::{Line, PermitSupply};
//! fn mix<'a, 'b, K>(supply: PermitSupply<'a, K, 1>, line: Line<'b, K, 2>) -> FifoPermitPool<'b, K, 1, 2> {
//!     FifoPermitPool::new(supply, line)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0308
//! # use oer_radio_permit_pool::FifoPermitPool;
//! # use oer_radio_port::{Line, PermitSupply};
//! fn short<'id, K>(supply: PermitSupply<'id, K, 1>, line: Line<'id, K, 2>) -> FifoPermitPool<'id, K, 1, 1> {
//!     FifoPermitPool::new(supply, line)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Its compiling twin fills a pool with its own install's permits and the
//! line of its seats:
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_radio_permit_pool::FifoPermitPool;
//! # use oer_radio_port::{Line, PermitSupply};
//! fn fill<'id, K>(supply: PermitSupply<'id, K, 1>, line: Line<'id, K, 2>) -> FifoPermitPool<'id, K, 1, 2> {
//!     FifoPermitPool::new(supply, line)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The pool is not `Sync`, so no other task shares it:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0277
//! # use oer_radio_permit_pool::FifoPermitPool;
//! fn shared<T: Sync>() {}
//! fn check<'id, K>() {
//!     shared::<FifoPermitPool<'id, K, 1, 2>>();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```
//! # use oer_radio_permit_pool::FifoPermitPool;
//! fn owned<T>() {}
//! fn check<'id, K>() {
//!     owned::<FifoPermitPool<'id, K, 1, 2>>();
//! }
//! ```
