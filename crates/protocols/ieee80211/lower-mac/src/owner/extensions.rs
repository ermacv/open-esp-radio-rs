//! The optional operations of a lower-MAC phase.
//!
//! A structural feature a backend may lack is an extension trait of the
//! phase or interface that performs it: an upper layer that needs the
//! feature requires the bound, and a backend without it does not implement
//! the trait. Every rule a caller controls is a type here, as in the base
//! contract: an aggregate's rate, traffic identifier and size; only the
//! world's outcome stays a result. No operation awaits: a setting takes
//! effect before the next submission, and what the hardware answers
//! arrives as an event.
//!
//! - [`AmpduPhase`]: one attempt sends one A-MPDU, built in an aggregate
//!   whose subframe count is the backend's limit, each subframe in a buffer
//!   of its own; the planner above the port resends the subframes the
//!   Block Ack report misses.
//! - [`BeaconTimingPhase`]: an interface's TSF and TBTT schedule; its TBTT
//!   events and TSF samples come in the phase's stream.
//! - [`AirReservationPhase`]: a gate's closing that reserves the access
//!   point's air for an absence of the station beside it.
//! - [`MonitorPhase`]: monitor reception, a radio-wide setting.
//!
