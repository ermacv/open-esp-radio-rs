//! The per-frame coexistence requests of a reconnecting station.
//!
//! After a station loses its association while another radio shares the air,
//! the vendor turns on its coexistence reconnect policy until the next
//! association starts power management. Under that policy each Probe Request
//! requests event 45, and each Authentication, (Re)Association Request and
//! EAPOL frame requests event 46 and carries that event's priority with a
//! priority count of 4000 instead of its ordinary one.
//!
//! SOURCE(esp32s31): complete pinned `libpp.a[pp.o]::pp_coex_tx_request`, which
//! `ppProcessTxQ` calls before `lmacTxFrame`; `libpp.a[pm_coex.o]::
//! pm_coex_reconnect_policy` and `pm_coex_set_reconnect_policy`;
//! `libpp.a[hal_mac.o]::mac_tx_set_pti`, which publishes the unsigned
//! minimum of the frame and slice priorities as the scheduler priority.
